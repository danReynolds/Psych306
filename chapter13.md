# Olfaction

**Orthonasal olfaction** = odors traveling in from nostrils to olfactory epithelium, occurs during normal smelling.

**Retronasal olfaction** = odors traveling from back of mouth into upper nasal cavity and olfactory epithelium from behind. Occurs when we eat and breathe and odors travel from mouth to the epithelium in reverse.

**Odor** = translation of a chemical stimulus into a smell sensation.

**Odorant** = molecule that is defined by its physicochemical characteristics, capable of being translated by the nervous system into the perception of a smell. The odorant methyl salicylate has the odor of winter-green mint.

To be smelled, odorant molecules must be:

1. Volatile: able to float through the air

2. Small: less than 5.8x10^-22g

3. Hydrophobic: Repellent to water

## Anatomy of the Nose

Inside of the nose has small ridges called turbinates that add turbulence to incoming air, causing a small puff of each breath to rise upward and pass through the **olfactory cleft** = a narrow space at the back of the noise into which air flows and where the olfactory epithelium is located.

**olfactory epithelium** = yellowish patch of mucous membrane whose primary function is to detect odorants in the air. Located on both sides of the upper portion of the nasal cavity and the olfactory clefts the olfactory epithelium contains three types of cells:

1. Olfactory sensory neurons: main type, OSNs are small neurons located beneath a mucous layer in the epithelim. The cilia on the OSN dendrites contain the receptor sites for odorant molecules.

The small OSN neurons have **cilia**, hairlike protrusions on teh dendrites of olfactory sensory neurons. The receptor sites for odorant molecules are on the cilia, which are the first structures involved in olfactory signal transduction. The cilia protrudes into the mucus covering the olfactory epithelium.

The cilia are the OSNs dendrites and they have **odorant receptors ORs** on their tips. Each OSN expresses only one type of OR and all OSNs with that same type of OR project to the same glomerulus.

The interaction between an odorant and the OR stimulates a biochemical event, producing an action potential that is transmitted along the axon of the OSN to the olfactory bulb.

2. Basal cells: Precursor cells to olfactory sensory neurons

3. Supporting cells: Provide metabolic and physical support for the olfactory sensory neurons.

We have an olfactory epithelium at the back of each nasal passage.

**Nasal dominance** = Our nostrils take in different amounts of air during the day and alternates throughout.

Humans can smell about the same number of scents as dogs, but dogs can sense odors at concentrations 100 million times lower than humans.

The axons on the ends of OSNs opposite the cilia pass through the **cribriform plate** a bony structure at the level of the eyebrows that separates the nose from the brain. If damaged, cannot smell because info can't reach the brain.

## Neurophysiology of Olfaction

OSN axons pass through the cribriform plate, bundle together to form the **olfactory nerve** and enter the blueberry-sized extension of the brain just above the nose called the **olfactory bulb**.

**Olfactory bulb** = Location where olfactory info is first processed, one in each brain hemisphere corresponding to the left and right nostril. Unlike other senses, ipsilateral so the right olfactory bulb gets info from the right nostril.

Most receptors aren't activated by a molecule, some are weakly activated and a few are strongly activated.

**Olfactory bulb** = first relay for the OSNs in the brain, sensory nerve ending gather together here to form tiny spheres called **glomeruli**.

The distinct pattern of OR activation for a specific odorant is translated to a specific pattern of spatial activity across the glomeruli.

go from responsive to many odorants to few odorants:

Respond to many odorants/outer layer of olfactory bulb: Juxtaglomerular neurons->Tufted cells->Mitral cells->few odorants/deepest layer of olfactory bulb.

**Granule cells** = like mitral cells, granule cells are at the deepest level of the olfactory bulb. Comprise an extensive network of inhibitory neurons, integrate inputs from all earlier projections and are the basis of specific odor identification.

Axons of the mitral and tufted cells of each bulb combine and form the **olfactory tract**, which sends odor info to the primary olfactory cortex, also called the **piriform cortex**.

The primary olfactory cortex includes the amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and the entorhinal cortex.

Brain structures that process olfactory info are all part of a network of structures called the **limbic system**.

**Limbic system** = olfactory cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex. Involved in emotion and memory. Olfactory is unique among the senses in its direct connection to the limbic system.

Sensation occurs when an odor is neurally registered, perception occurs when we become aware of detecting a scent.

The more intense our perception of the retronasal aroma of food, the less we tend to consume it.

## Feel of Scent

Most odorants stimulate the somatosensory system to some degree through the polymodal nociceptors (touch, pain and temperature receptors) inside the nose.

Menthol feels cool, ammonia feels burning.

These sensations are transmitted by the **trigeminal nerve**.

## From Chemicals to Smells

**shape pattern theory** = odorant molecules have different shapes and olfactory receptors have different shapes and an odorant will be detected by a specific OR to the extent that the odorant's molecules fit into the OR.

When a given odorant is sniffed, a particular pattern is generated across the glomeruli.

Chemicals of specific shapes fit receptors with shapes that best accommodate them.

The specific pattern of glomerular activity in the olfactory bulb then determines the particular scent we perceive.

Alternative to shape theory is **vibration theory** = every odorant has a different vibrational frequency and that molecules that produce the same vibrational frequnecies will smell the same.

**Specific anosmia** = Inability to smell one specific compound amid otherwise normal smell perception. Due to faulty OR interactions or missing specific ORs.

Androstenone = found in armpit sweat and pork, between 20-60% of the population have an anosmia to it, but those who can are broken into two groups, those who describe it as unpleasant and urinous and those who find it pleasant and a sweet, musky floral scent. Due to genetic differences in OR.

**Stereoisomers** = molecules that are mirror-image rotations of one another. Contain all the same atoms, but can smell completely different. Rotated molecules do  not fit the same receptors, like trying to fit a left hand into a right glove. Therefore different receptors are activated for each and we perceive different smells.

If two odorants activate the same receptors in the same way, we smell the same thing. This is how we can make artifical scents for fruits and such.

## Odor Perception Synthetic is both Analytical

Olfactory perception can be both analytical and synthetic. **binaral rivalry** = competition between the two nostrils for odor perception. When a different scent is presented to each nostril simultaneously, we perceive each scent to be alternating back and forth with the other, rather than a blend.

**Olfactory white** = the olfactory equivalent of white noise, or the color white. At least 30 odorants of equal intensity that span olfactory physiochemical and psychological perceptual space mixed together so that they produce a resultant odor percept that is the same as every other mixture of 30 odorants meeting the span and equivalent intensity criteria even though the various mixtures do not share any common odorants.

## Sniffing

Sniffing increases the ability to detect odorants over passive inhaling.

## Odor Imagery

Humans have no ability to conjure odor images. Dreams with olfactory sensations are also rare.

### Detection, Discrimination and Recognition

Olfactory detection thresholds depend on factors:

Odorant molecules with long carbon chains easier than short for example.

In smell we can trigger memories for scents we don't even know, as long as we've just experienced it before.

**Staircase method** = example of the method of limits, odorant is presented in ever-increasing concentration increments until the participant reports that they are able to smell something for severeal repeats of that concentration. The the odorant's concentration is decreased incrementally until the participant reports no detection.

Repeat these reversals over a number of trials and then average the result to determine the approximate concentration required for that person to detect the odorant.

**triangle test** = used to determine if a person can discriminate between two odorants, given three odorants to smell of which two are the same and one is different. Participant states which is the unique odour.

## Identification

In English there are very few words to identify smells, limited to :

aromatic, fragrant, pungent, stinky are the only ones that describe olfactory stimuli and nothing else.

Women outperform men in odor perception in all areas. Ability to detect odorants also declines with age, because ORs die off faster than they are regenerated.

## Adaptation

Sense of smell is a change detection system. When a new chemical comes along, olfactory receptors fire in response.

When exposed to a scent for a long time, odorant molecules that make up the aroma have bound to the corresponding olfactory sensory neurons and the ORs retreat into the cell body. The receptors are no longer able to respond to those molecules.

This response is a process in *receptor recycling*, odorant binding to an OR causes the Or to be internalized into the cell body, where it becomes unbound from the odorant and recycled through the cell and emerges again in a number of minutes.

takes 15-20 min for the molecules of an odorant to stop eliciting an olfactory response.

**Cross adaptation** = the reduction in detection of one odorant following the exposure to another odorant. Components of the odors share one or more ORs. Like smelling one perfume and going on to smell another and not being able to smell it despite it being different.

## Cognitive Habituation

When we live with an odor, we cognitively habituate to it and no longer react to it, or we should a very diminished response to it. Cognitive habituation requires weeks to reverse.

## Olfactory Hedonics

**Odor hedonics** = the liking dimension of odor perception, typically measured by ratings of an odor's perceived pleasantness, familiarity and intensity.

Evidence shows that our hedonic responses to odors are learned and not innate.

## Learned Taste Aversion

Can learn to avoid a flavor by being made sick after consumption.

## Vomeronasal Organ, Human Pheromones and Chemosignals

In animals that rely on smell for survival, the olfactory system consists of two subsystems:

1. Main olfactory bulb (MOB): The olfactory bulb, the blueberry sized extension of the brain just above the nose, the first region of the brain where smells are produced.

2. Accessory Olfactory bulb (AOB): The AOB is attached to the back of the MOB.

In order for the AOB to be activated, a structure different from the nose needs to be engaged. This structure is called the **vomeronasal organ**. The VNO is found in some amphibians, most reptiles and many mammals.

Responds primarily to chemicals that are higher in molecular weight than can be detected by the olfactory sensory neurons, as well as to chemicals that are non-volatile. Can also detect chemicals dissolved in water.

We do not have an AOB or VNO. In animals with a VNO, its primary function is to detect **pheromones**. Pheromones are not odors, they are chemicals that may or may not have a smell. Pheromones are emitted by one member of a species and triggers a physiological or behavioral response in another member of the same species.

Pheromones have two kinds of effects:

1. Primer phereomones: effects are slow and produce a physiological change in the recipient over time.

2. Releaser pheromones: effects are fast and always produce behavioral responses.

Period synchronization is believed to be caused by chemicals present in human sweat that are capable of priming the hormonal systems of individuals. However, other research suggests that human pheromones are a myth and believe this isn't true.

**Chemosignal** = chemicals emitted by humans that are detected by the olfactory system and that may have some effect on the mood or behavior of other humans.

Androstadienone is a steroid derivative of testosterone, and has been observed to improve women's mood but only in the presence of men.

Women ovulating receive more tips, result of some chemical interaction. Chemicals found in the tears of women dampen the sexual desire of men.

Olfaction is primarily sensory rather than analytical, hard to analyze odors and determine things from mixtures.
