Daniel Kish TED talk:

* Was not raised with fear, matter of nurture that we acquire lots of our fear
* Clicks, makes flashes of sound like a bat's sonar so that he can discern what's around him
* Flash sonar, flashes of understanding as a result of clicking.
* Activation training for thousands of people across many countries
* 360 degree view, works around corners, through surfaces, fuzzy 3D geometry
* Something like having x-ray vision, says one of his instructors
* forms images in visual cortex, the imaging system

Transcript points:

* its society that is more dangerous to blind people than their blindness

> It's impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself.

* born with bilateral retinoblastoma, retinal cancer
*
> Three hundred and sixty-degree view, so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me. It works around corners. It works through surfaces. Generally, it's kind of a fuzzy three-dimensional geometry. One of my students, who has now become an instructor, when he lost his vision, after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house: conversations, people in the kitchen, people in the bathroom, several floors away, several walls away. He said it was something like having x-ray vision.

What are our human limits for this sort of flash sonar? Surely we aren't as sensitive as many animals.

> It's impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself.

Science to back this up?

## Structure of Essay:

* Explain sonar
* Explain what it means to have flash sonar, what is he doing, spatial geometry
* Explain nature, how we are raised to be fearful of certain things
* What the visual cortex is useful for, why he calls it the imaging system
* Talk about the retina, since he has retinal cancer
