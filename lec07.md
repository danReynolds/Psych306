## Grandmother Cell

Cell in the brain dedicated to grandmother identification?

Jennifer Aniston cell? Cell responds to certain person.

The visual info triggers also with related people, so the Luke Skywalker cell also triggered for Yoda.

If there was a separate cell for representing each distinct kind of object, then the day something new is introduced, you'd have to have a new cortical neuron, not practical.

## Object Recognition is fast

Only 150ms to begin recognizing an object.

## Feedforward

Assembly line, data going down info processing stream. Not consulting things, just going down a path fast.

One neural step after another without need of feedback from a later or earlier stage.

## Feedback and Re-entrant processing

Info being fed back from further down the line or info doubling back into itself. We don't finish after the initial recognition on 150ms, but it sends signals forwards and back afterwards to draw in information.

Things are revised, corrected and developed further.

## Illusory Contour

Puts together overall gist of the scene even though shape has no edges, like an arrow embedded into a system of circles.

Structuralists cannot account for why we can see the arrow and abstractions like this.

## Perceptual Committees

Get object recognition through the metaphor of a perceptual committee.

Idea is that you have lots of neurons that work together with a set of rules to come together and agree that the combination of stimuli means "person" or "animal" and these low order neurons pool their information together that pass it on to a set of neurons that make higher and higher evaluations until you get to the chair of the committee, who decides that indeed you have seen a person or an animal of some sort.

These are the layers of visual processing and get to object recognition.

## Gestalt Grouping rules

Gestalt psychologists

**Good Continuation** = see an arrow through someone's head, see the pieces and Gestalt grouping says that in general you understand that there's one continuous arrow, and more abstractly just shapes in general.

**Closure** = going to see closure even if a circle has a gap. Your mind closes the break in the form.

**Similarity** = similarly looking items are grouped together. Group green circles together, separately from the red circles.

**Proximity** = group things by how close they are to one another and far from everything else

**Parallelism** = group things by whether they're in a line, parallel with eachother. Parallel contours are likely to form a group.

**Symmetry** = more like to form a group if they're symmetrical.

**Common Regions** = if a bunch of items are spaced on a common region, like a yellow patch, they will be grouped together

**Synchrony** = if things are changing color or size together then we tend to group them

**Common Fate** = objects moving in the same direction are more related than stationary or those moving separately.

**Texture Segmentation** = group things together that have the same texture.

**Camouflage** = A lot of animal camouflage is for hiding, but a lot of other camouflage is to create confusion. Prevent others from seeing you and grouping things together to discern the object correctly. Can you tell the important areas or whether it's one or many objects. Try to break up the grouping.

Octopus changes its texture so well that it can't be discerned as an object on its own.
