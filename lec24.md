# Taste vs Flavour

There is a back connection between the mouth and the nose. When you eat, you force air out of the mouth and into the olfactory epithelium. The air that picks up particles from chewing is picked up by smell. This is called **Retronasal breathing**.

Flavour is a combination of taste from the mouth and the olfactory sensations that you get from Retronasal olfactory sensations.


## Fungiform Papillae

Taste buds are inside each of the papillae, by the tip of the tongue.

Left side of the tongue handled by right side of the brain. The taste buds themselves are like little round blobs made up of segments embedded inside papillae.

## Basic Tastes

Sweet, Sour, Bitter, Saltiness.

## Umami

The taste produced by MSG. Doesn't qualify as 5th taste, not a hard-wired effect.

## Nontasters and Supertasters

Some people have more tastebuds than others. In cross-modality testing, the people with more tastebuds, the supertasters, reported a very different experience of mapping lighting to bitterness.

Non-tasters experience a dull light in cross modality when presented with bitter tastes. They are experiencing a dialed down version of the taste spectrum.

When supertasters were exposed to a sample of prop, some bitter thing, it was like a blinding flash of light and much more painful and intense than for non-tasters or tasters.

## Innate Preferences

Babies like sweet things. There are innate preferences and acquired tastes. Spiciness is an acquired taste.

## Specifics Hunger Theory

Whenever we are deficient in salty or sweet things, we develop a craving for them that increases our sensitivity to them. The junk food industry perpetuates this craving. Specific hunger theory holds up well for salty and sweet.

But no evidence for vitamins that there are cravings for those vitamin intensive foods.

## Cross-Adaptation

Experience of the taste of one food affecting the taste of another. After brushing teeth and having juice, the second tastes different. The sweet toothpaste makes the juice taste more sour. This is cross adaptation.

## Orthonasal vs Retronasal

Orthonasal is breathing in through the nostrals and the sensation you get from the air moving from the front of the face to the back of the head across the olfactory epithelium. Retronasal is the same thing but air moving from the back to the front across the olfactory epithelium.

There are smells we like that we don't want to eat. We could acquire preferences for orthonasal olfactory sensations separately from retronasal olfactory sensations.

But this behaves differently the other way, for aversions, like not liking the taste of something makes you not like the smell of it either. You can learn to dislike something by smelling it and it will make you not like the taste and vice-versa, but this isn't true for positive tastes.
