# Change Blindness

Don't notice a change in an image or environment.

# Object-Centered Neglect

Just don't notice things on the contralateral side, perhaps in the room, field of vision, or even on their bodies.

If move a neglected object to the non-neglected are by having them watch you move it over to non-neglected side, then they still can't see it once it is in the non-neglected side.

## Simultagnosia

Balint syndrome. Have Simultagnosia, cannot identify multiple objects at the same time. Associated with bilateral damage to the parietal lobe. Very limited capacity to attention.

Extinction to the extreme.

## Selective Processing

Metaphorically zooming in and binding features together to find targets for your search.

This is the kind of thing you do in visual search, trying to find an object based on its features.

Getting features like color, size, orientation about a specific object.

## Non-selective Processing

Happens in parallel to selective processing, taking in and appreciating the overall mean and variance of the features of the image. Overall processing of this image is mostly green, or vertical line based, etc.

General info about the scene, scene based guidance.

## Ensemble Statistics

Averages of what's going on in the scene, average distribution of different properties like orientation and color. At a glance, know general orientation, direction, color of objects in scene.

To figure out something more specific like if there is an object facing the other direction, need selective pathway, takes more work.

Ensemble statistics are the pieces of info that describe the overall image. Overall, what color are they on average, overall what way are they going. This process is very fast.

Non-selective pathway is giving info about the gist of a scene and its spatial layout very quickly.

Can pick out some basic properties of the overall scene.

Show people side-by-side images and have them pick the one that has the animal in it ASAP, can be done in as little as 120ms.

Most of that 120ms is also spent on eye movement, not even the non-selective processing.

Figuring out if a scene is natural or urban is 19ms. Non-selective pathway is very fast.

Can also work out whether a scene is open or closed very quickly.

## Openness

Look at a landscape and ask if it feels wide open or enclosed and cluttered.

Can be figured out very quickly with biological analysis.

## Memory for Objects and Scenes

Very good at remembering objects and scenes.

## Things we Miss

Studies have show that we can miss changes, especially if the changes don't change the meaning of the scene.

Our mind isn't encoding a bit-by-bit file, we're encoding meaning. If the meaning of the picture doesn't change, we don't care.

Flickering the image and changing inbetween and gradual changes can cause us to overlook things.

## Blink Comparator

Take pairs of images of a starscape along with a gap of time and blink them back and forth, visual system finds the difference.

## Attentional Bottleneck

Attention is a limited resource. Need to attend to a subset of the information infront of you.

Inattentional blindness is consequence of overlooking things. When we can't make attention to everything uniformly, we miss changes and we miss information.

Inattentional blindness is like the gorilla, paying attention to one thing and dont notice a second thing

## Change Blindness Example

Guy with map asks someone how to get somewhere, person walks inbetween and subs them out, half didn't notice the person change and kept describing the directions.
