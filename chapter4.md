## Perceiving and Recognizing objects

Primary visual cortex = V1/Striate Cortex

## What and Where Pathways

Cells in V1 are interested in the basic features of the visual image, responding to edges or lines of specific orientation, motion, size, etc.

Beyond the V1 is the **extrasiate cortex**, a set of visual areas that lie outside the striate cortex and labeled V2, V3, etc.

Basic, local properties are pulled out of the image by early stages of visual cortex, but sophisticated tassks like object recognition require a great deal of processing and many visual processing areas.

In V2 and beyond, receptive fields show an interest in properties that will be important for object perception.

V2 cells care about boundary ownership. They might respond to a dark edge of an object, but not a dark edge created by a light object on a dark background.

From the extrastriate regions of the occipital lobe of the brain, visual info moves out along two main pathways:


1. *Where* Pathway: One pathway leads up to the parietal lobe. Visual areas in this pathway are important for processing info relating to the location of objects in space and the actions required to interact with them. This pathway is important for attention.

2. *What* Pathway: heads down into the temporal lobe, location for the explicit acts of object recognition.

## Agnosia

Seeing things, but not being able to recognize the objects.

The Inferotemporal cortex has clls that spread over half or more of a monkey's field of view.

This suggests a hierarchical model of visual perception in which small receptive fields and simple features of the visual cortex are combined with greater complexity as one moves from the striate cortex to IT cortex, eventually culminating in a cell that might fire when ou see your grandmother or someoene you know.


The **grandmother cell** stands for any cell that seems to be selectively responsive to one specific object.

The IT cortex maintains close connections with parts of the brain involved in memory formation, which is important because the IT cells need to memorize their receptive field properties. The properties of the primary visual cortex cells could be written into genetic code, but neurons that respond to objects are not hardwired.

After training monkeys to recognize objects, IT neurons responded with high firing rates for those objects, but only when seen from viewpoints similar to those already seen.

it was determined that some cells responded only to Jennifer Aniston, and others had preferences for certain other people.

These cells are grouped together, and there are areas where we know cells are interested in faces, vs spaces like rooms.

**Prosopagnosia** = inability to recognize faces.

Others include inability to recognize immobile objects vs moving objects.

How do we distinguish a snowman infront of a house from being part of the house? Need processes that successfully combine features into objects. That is one of the tasks in the **Middle vision**.

## Middle vision

goal is to organize the elements of a visual scene into groups that can be recognized as objects.

### Finding edges

**Illusory Contours** see edges where visually there is no color change, like with an arrow next to lines and the same color as the background.

The tendency of the visual system to make inferential leaps is problematic for **structuralists**. Structuralists like Wilhelm Wundt argued that perceptions are the sum of atoms of sensations, bits of color, orientation and so on. Perception is built up of local sensations the way a crystal is built of atoms.

An illusory contour challenges this because there are no such atoms in certain areas, it'd be like if a crystal could have a floating piece to it.

A second group formed the **Gestalt** school, that said that the perceptual whole is more than the sum of its sensory parts.

## Perceptual Committees

A number of rules and good guesses contribute to our organized perception of the world. These seem to operate according to a sort of committee model. Everyone gets together and voices opinions about how the stimulus ought to be understood. Might see closure, where we see objects with a closed contour over an open one, which could be at odds with good continuation, that groups objects together if they lie along the same contour.

When the opinions of different committee members collide, the results can be unpredictable.

## Occlusion

If an edge stops, it might be because something else gets in its way. There is an occluding edge blocking it.

## Texture Segmentation and Grouping

Grouping areas together based on common textures. The statistics of all the features in one region may be different from the statisitics in another region.

## Similarity

the tendency of two features to group toeether will increase as the similarity between them increases. Includes color, size, orientation, aspects of form.

## Proximity

the tendences of two features to group together will increase as the distance between them decreases.

## Parallelism

Parallel contours likely belong to the same figure.

## Symmetry

symmetrical regions are more likely to be seen as a figure.

## Camouflage

Same principles that are normally used to help find objects in the world can also hide them. The art of getting your features to group with the features of the environment.

## Perceptual Committees Revisited

The collection of information has to be interpreted before we can know what we're seeing. Middle vision behaves like a collection of specialists, each with a specific area of expertise and individual opinions about what the input might mean.

Selfridge's Pandemonium model is one example, noise and chaos, Feature demons find lines and angles, passing them to cognitive demons, one for each letter, that made noise depending on how strongly it felt its letter was constituted.

A decision demond listened to the committee of cognitive demons and identified the ltter on the basis of the loudest yell.

The physical version of this committee is a massively interconnected set of neurons that taek input and produce output that can be read as a decision.

## Committee Rules: Honor Physical and Avoid Accidents

An **ambiguous figure** is a figure that generates two or more possible interpretations. Middle vision committees are willing to see the object as one of several possible recognitions.

An **accidental viewpoint** is a viewing position that produces some regularity in the visual image that is not present in the world. Any slight shift in viewpoint would destroy the illusion. Such as squishing a person's head with your finger, or pushing up the tower of Pisa.

A committee considers all possibilities and devalues any that involve accidental viewpoint.

## Figure and Ground

Ability to distinguish figures of objects in the foreground from ground, surfaces or objects, lying behind the figures. Process governed by a collection of principles acting together. Rubin faces trick us by having it look like faces in the foreground, or a vase in the foreground.

For the Rubin vase, we use:

1. *Surroundedness*: If one region is entirely surrounded by another, it is likely that the surrounded region is the figure.

2. *Size*: The smaller region is likely to be the figure.

3. *Symmetry*: A symmetrical region is more likely to be seen as a figure.

4. *Parallelism*: Regions with parallel contours are more likely to be seen as figure.

5. *Extremal Edges:* Figure-ground calculations are intended to answer the question, "Is Region A infront of Region B?". Edges can make one object look like the figure over the other depending on the shading and texture relative to the adjacent space.

6. *Relative Motion*: How things move can determine which portion of a display is the figure and which is the ground.

## Dealing with Occlusion

Objects are often partially hidden by other objects, how do we understand the continuation of a contour when it disappears from view behind an occluder?

**Relatability** = the degree to which two line segments appear to be part of the same contour.

A more complex curve is harder to continue if occluded than a simpler one. This heuristic doesn't always work, but is a good rule.

If we have a box in front of a box, we can get  Y, T and arrow junctions, where lines meet.

T junctions almost always occur when one surface occludes another, while Y and arrow junctions are usually corners and don't correspond to occlusion.

These features are called **nonaccidental features** because they are features of an object that is not dependent on the viewping position of the observer.

## Parts and Wholes

Consider a letter H made up of smaller letter H's. Did you find the global one faster than the small local ones?

The **Global Superiority Effect** is the finding in various experiments that the properties of the whole of the object take precedence over the properties of parts of the object.

## Summarizing Middle Vision

Early-vision processes gave us the local features in the visual world. Middle-vision processes began the work of understanding what those local features might be telling us about the state of the world.

Middle vision as discussed so far can be broken up into 5 principles:

1. *Bring together that which should be brought together*: We have the Gestalt grouping principles, and we have the processes that complete contours and objects even when they are partially hidden behind occluders.

2. *Split Asunder that which should be split Asunder*: Complementing the grouping principles are the edge-finding processes that divide regions from eachother. Figure-ground mechanisms separate objects from the background, texture segmentation processes divide one region from the next on the basis of image statistics.

3. *Use what you know*: Two-dimensional edge configurations are taken to indicate three-dimensional corners or occlusion borders, and objects are divided into parts on the basis of an implicit knowledge of the physics of image formation.

4. *Avoid accidents*: Avoid interpretations that require the assumptions of highly specific, accidental combinations of features or accidental viewpoints.

5. *Seek Consensus and avoid Ambiguity*: Every image is ambiguous, there are always multiple even infinite physical situations that could generate a given image. Using the first four principles, the committees of middle vision must eliminate all but one of the possibilities, resolving ambiguity and delivering a single solution

## From Metaphor to model

There are formal ways to model the way in which knowledge about regularities in the world can constrain the interpretation of ambiguous sensory input.

The **Bayesian approach** calculates the probability of something, given something else.

If I see a letter B overlapping the edges of two pieces of paper, is this a C on top of two pieces of paper, or half an E and half a 3 on the separate pieces of paper that when they come together make a B, or a B on top of a piece of paper. The C is inconsistent with the given data, but plausible in reality. The E and 3 is plausible given the data, but unlikely given that we'd have to be lined up at an accidental viewpoint to see it that way, so we see it as a B on top of a piece of paper.

## Object recognition

Traveling the *What* pathway from V1 into the temporal lobe, we can see a progressive change in the responses of cells in different visual areas. In V2, we get early steps from features to objects.

**Material recognition** = we are good at categorizing the material that an object looks like it is made of, glass stone, etc. We use material perception to estimate physical properties like how it would feel.

**Substraction method** = If you should a human observer a series of pictures of spaces like rooms and fields, lots of pieces of the brain will be activated by these places. If you then scramble the images so that they are not identifiable as a place, still lots of pieces of the brain will be activated. But if you subtract the two patterns of activation, there will be at least one region called the **parahippocampal place area (PPA)** that is specifically and reliably activated more by places than by other stimuli.

Other well-esetablished specialized areas include the:

**fusiform face area (FFA)** for faces and the **extrastriate body area (EBA)** for images of the body other than the face.

## Templates versus Structural Descriptions

**Naive template theory**: we recognize objects by matching every pixel or low-level feature of the input to a representation in memory.

Problem is that too many templates are required.

**Structural Description**: A description of an object in terms of the nature of its constituent parts and the relationships between those parts. So instead of matching a template exactly, we know that a capital letter A has two lines meeting at an approximate angle, and one crossing them at about 2/3rds up.

A set of building blocks, geometric ions called *geons* were proposed as the ways to compose structural descriptions. A collection of non accidental features, so a visual system should be able to recognize a geon equally accurately and quickly regardless of orientation.

**Recognition by components model:** Biederman's mode of object recognition, which holds that objects are recognized by the identities and relationships of their component parts.

The goal is to make structure descriptions composed of geons *viewpoint invariant*. If we can derive the same structural description, 2 square geons, etc, then we only need to store one representation, which is much more reasonable than a vast number of specific templates.

## Problems with Structural-Description Theories

Viewpoint invariance is a good thing, but there is often something viewpoint-dependent about object recognition.

Also, are geons specific enough? Is a structural description of a book versus a book in a box different given the limited geons we have?

## Views

View-based, which are template-like representations, were proposed by Michael Tarr and others. They took made up letters and rotated them and found that the time it took to recognize them was linearly related to the amount of rotation.

Subjects may have stored a template-like representation of the object during training, and then recognized it upside down by mentally rotating it back to the upright view/template they had stored in their memory. This would go against the viewpoint invariant approach of structural descriptions.

## Multiple Recognition Committees

Bird could be an **entry level category**, when we see different types of birds, but these objects are more specific. At a subordinate level, it could be a cardinal versus a blue jay, but at a superordinate level, it is a bird.

And at a broader level above the entry level, it is an animal.

Each of these recognitions can rely on different stored representations and different analyses of visual stimulus.

A geon of a bird might be possible, but a geon of a sparrow is too specific.

It takes longer to recognize objects at the subordinate or superordinate level than at the entry level.

Different parts of the brain are more active when they are recognizing objects at the subordinate level than the entry level.

Also interesting, when shown an atypical model of an entity level object, like an ostrich, it will be defined at the subordinate level of ostrich before the entry level of bird, which is abnormal.

When one becomes an expert at a subordinate level, they can recognize them at this subordinate level as well as at the entity level. Bird watchers have shift down their specificity ability to the subordinate level for blue jays vs cardinals, they see those entities as well as the entry level recognition of bird.

## Faces: An Illustrative Special Case

Faces are an interesting special case of object recognition. If you have two faces upside and modified, hard to tell what the difference is. Viewpoint is very important, as upright faces are much more easily identified than inverted ones.

**Prosopagnosia**: cannot identify a face

**Double dissociation**: Two functions such as hearing and sight are double dissociated if one can be damaged without harm to the other and vice-versa. You can be blind and still hear for example.

In face recognition, it is possible to lose the subordinate ability to recognize a specific face, which maintaining the entry level recognition of the object as a face.

**Congenital Prosopagnosia**: form of face blindness, present from birth as opposed to acquired prosopagnosia.

## The Pathway Runs in Both Directions: Feedback and Reentrant Processing

Neural processing is not a one-way street, not just a feed-forward manner. Most object recognition will involve information flowing both up and down these pathways.

Receptive fields get bigger and bigger as you ascend the "what" pathway. The cells care less about where the object is or how it is oriented. But you know that the object, like the Eiffel tower, is in a certain spot, with a red light at the top. This precision is probably achieved by going back down the pathway, once you have information about the object, and interrogating earlier visual areas about the details of this instance of the object. This is a reentrant process.

The act of object recognition is a conversation among many pieces of the brain rather than a progression from spots and lines to the activation of a grandmother cell in the inferotemporal complex.

**Attention** to an object is critical in recognition of that object. Cells in different parts of the brain may behave differently before and after attention is directed to an object. Many of the brain structures critical for the deployment of attention lie in the pathh coming out of the primary visual cortex into the parietal lobe.

The first, rough acts of object recognition take place so fast that they must be accomplished by a one-pass, feed-forward sweep. But routine perception involves a conveersation among many pieces.
