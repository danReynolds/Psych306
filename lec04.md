Humans can discriminate 400nm (violet)-700nm (red) wavelength.

Vision is the ability to discriminate between wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.


## Exterior of Eye:

Zonules of Zin, hold ligaments in place.

Iris, sphincter muscle, opens closes.

Main volume of the eye is the vitreous humor, a gilatenous goo, thick jello and transparent, filling the interior of the eye.

Refract through the lens, cornea, pupil

## Interior of Eye:

Back of the retina is the **pigment epithelium**, a dark pigmented layer at the very back of the retina.

**Choroid** doing things for nutrition.

**Sclera** tough layer to hold the gelotonous balloon that is the contents of the eye.

Try to focus the light from the pupil and cornea into the rods and cones in the retina and fovea.

Straight back from pupil to retina is a **small dent** in the retina called the **fovea**. When someone says look at me, you point your eyes such that their image falls on the fovea, the focus point of the eye. Densely populated with cones. Detailed and colored vision is concentrated in the fovea, a part of the retina.

**optic disc**, optic nerve, all the neurons lining the inner surface of the eye need to go to the brain, and it is this circular patch at the back of the eye where there are many nerve endings and no photoreceptors, making it a blind spot. Visual system usually interpolates what should be there, fills in that space for you. This optic disc has all the ends of the optic nerves running through it like a wall socket.

## Accommodation

Changing the shape of the lens to alter how it refracts the light coming in, want to have it refract onto the retina in focus.

If your eyes don't do this well, you get corrective lenses.

With age, lens becomes less flexible, and changes where the point of focus is.

**Emmetropia** = light refracts perfectly through the eye, get good vision
**Myopia** = light is focusing short of the retina, things close are okay, but far away become blurry
**Hyperopia** = light is focusing beyond the retina, cannot see things close up as accurately
**Stygmatism** = Person has a refraction problem in one of the eyes only. Have them look at straight edges and if the edge has a wobble in it, part of the eye is refracting it incorrectly.

## Other Layers in the Retina

Lots of inner nuclear layers in the retina. Drawing conclusions in the retina before the optic nerve about light received.

Light goes right through these neuron cells, transparent to the light, actual business end of photoreceptors in the eye is at the very back, goes through these inner nucleus layers first before getting to the rods and cones. These layers are the wirings that pass light onto the cones and rods at the back of the eye and move it on to the optic nerve for transmission to the brain.

**retinal ganglion cells** are a bundle that create the optic disc.

## Photoreceptors

### Rods

sensory neurons. Have an outer segment next to the pigment epithelium. Inner segment manufactures pigment, light sensitive pigment. This pigment is stored in the outer segment. There is a protein in it called an opsin. Rods have rhodopsin. This pigment responds when hit by light and determines which frequencies of light that photoreceptor is sensitive to.

Rods are sensitive to the whole spectrum of visible light. The entire retina except for the fovea is tiled with rods.

A rod can detect levels of light, but not color. Peripheral vision are rods, but little color information in photorceptors, rods in peripherals. Rods are very sensitive, need little light, good in low-light conditions.

## Cones

The Fovea is densely tiled with three different kinds of cones. They have different pigments, one that responds with long, medium and short wavelengths of light respectively.
Cones can only sense a portion of the visible spectrum, RGB and in combinations they are able to determine color.

Cones are used to discriminate between different colors of light. Need more light to be able to discriminate between them. Get very good detailed vision from the fovea.

RGB - red cones longest wavelength, green cones medium, blue cones shortest

present in different concentrations, rarest are the blue ones. Most common are the red ones. We don't have a lot of sensitivity for the short wavelengths of light, the blues and violets.

Cones are sensitive to a range of wavelengths, and large overlap between red and green that together compare combinations of them and come to a conclusion about the color you see.

5% of all men are red-green colorblind. Poor streetlights.

> Vision is not merely a matter of passive perception, it is an intelligent process of active construction. What you see is invariably what your visual intelligence constructs

## Define, Compare and contrast

questions will ask you to define two things, compare the two things and say what they have in common, and then contrast the things that are different.

ex. rods and cones are good for compare and contrast.

## Dark and Light Adaptation

Iris opens up to let in as much light as possible. Pigments are used up absorbing light, so if lot of light coming in, the photopigments in the retina where the most light is hitting are getting used up and harder to process information.

If little light, more photopigments available to process light. See more, because more photopigments available. Ignore a bunch of light intuitively, because need to replenish photopigments.

Inner segment is working on this while we are processing, being stored to the outer segment of the photoreceptor as soon as possible.
