# Aperture Opening

If you have a hole into a larger world, when a moving object goes past that window, there are multiple possible scenarios that could create the view you had through that window.

There are lots of ways that something could be moving to create that view. Only see part of its shape, need to figure out what it is and what its motion is. These ambiguities are difficult to resolve.

## Akinetopsia

Cannot see motion. Damage to MT, part of brain, things appear in new places, but don't see transition.

## Interocular Transfer

Transfers from one eye to the other. Wherever adapting to motion, it is happening after combining info from two eyes.

## Optic Flow

As you move, everything in visual field moves on retina.

## Time to Collision

How long until slam into wall, time until collision.

TAU = how quickly is target on retina expanding
