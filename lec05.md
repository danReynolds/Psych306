## Visual acuity

How fine, detailed an image you can discriminate.

The fovea is about 4 degrees of visual angle, very small part of vision is going to the fovea, it is your focus point.

Properties of the fovea and periphery in human vision:

Property:             Fovea:                 Periphery:
Photoreceptor Type    Mostly cones           Mostly rods
Bipolar Cell Type     Midget                 Diffuse
Convergence           Low                    high
Receptive-Field size  Small                  large
Acuity                High                   Low
Light Sensitivity     Low                    high

### Graded Potentials

Photoreceptors give a variable signal. They are delivering a graded potential

Vertical pathways have cone or cones synapse through to a retinal ganglion cell or rods synapse through to a retinal ganglion cells, but not mix.

Also have horizontal pathways, retinal cells get info back and forth from neighbouring rods or cones and send an accumulated signal down to the bipolar cells. Bipolar cells get info directly from photoreceptors, as well as accumulated signals horizontally from photoreceptors in the horizontal neighbourhood.

Amacrine cells have horizontal pathways, synapsing between bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells, can be involved in contrast enhancement, but not sure.

What if neurons could influence their neighbours?

Have a bunch of tiles, each representing the signals from photoreceptors on the retina that are monitored by the bipolar cells and such that observe the signals. They have a graded potential, all signaling a 5 for example. You can excite a neuron or inhibit it.

If one tile is a 15, it will inhibits its neighbours, making them 4s as a reponse to that.

If there's a strip of 15s, you knock down the frame around them, costing accuracy and uniformity. The strip of 15s become 14, 13, 13, 14 as a result of infuence from neighbours.

This is **Lateral Inhibition**, neuronal mechanism that inhibits the response of nearby neurons. The nearby neurons are not able to fire, making the contrast greater from 15 next to 14 to 15 next to 4.

The more excited you get, the more you're inhibiting your neighbours, giving more contrast in these areas.

Lateral inhibition sets contrast levels at edges, so because of what neighbours it, we can see a 15 in one spot as different from a 15 somewhere else because it neighbours 2s vs 5s.

The contrast between two neighbouring things is caused by lateral inhibition.

**transduce** = convert from one form of energy to another

**visual acuity** = the finest detail that can be resolved by the eyes

### Mach Bands

Gray stripes from light to dark, each being the same color per stripe, will appear to have a gradient when bordering successfully uniformly darker stripes.

## Retinal Ganglion Cells

**P Retinal Ganglion Cells** = as many as there are cones in the fovea. Midget bipolar cells have 1:1 relation to these cells. Responsible for shape-processing, detailed and colored vision, good spatial resolution, poor temporal resolution, so things happening at different points at time.

P-ganglion cells have more sustained firing.

**M Ganglion Cells** = Get info from diffuse bipolar cells, which gets info from multiple rods and sends it to these M ganglion cells. Have good temporal resolution, but poor spatial resolution. One diffuse bipolar cells gets data from many rods, and sends that to the M ganglion cell, don't know which rod you get the data from down the line, so poor for spatial, detailed vision.

Have more bursty firing, allowing for temporal resolution, can tell excitement apart better than the constant firing of P.

## ON/Off cells

You have on-cells and off-cells. On P-retinal ganglion cells and off P-retinal ganglion cells and same for M.

There is a **receptive field** with Center and a Surround.

### On-center Ganglion Cell
If you shine light on the center of an on-cell, the light causes an excited reaction.
If you shine light on the surround of the on-cell, it has a short initial reaction, realizes its on the surround and is not excited. Just excited when the light goes on and off, on the transition, not during.

### Off-center Ganglion Cell

If you shine light on the center of an off-cell, it has a reaction on the end transition, maybe the start a little bit but it not excited in the center while the light is on.

If you shine light on the surround, the off-cell is excited. So opposite the on-cell.

Small patch of light in center = some excitement
Large patch of light fully covering center = lots of excitement
Larger patch of light covering the center and part of the surround = less excitement, because worse contrast between the center and the surround
Largest patch of light covering both the center and the surround = not excited because no contrast

### Convergence

A lot more photoreceptors than retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). So a lot of photoreceptors send signals to a smaller number of RGCs.

In the periphery, greater convergence, many, many rods to one RGC. In the fovea, much lower convergence, one cone to one RGC.

Very sensitive to low levels of light in periphery, but vague about where signal coming from.

Foveal has good spatial resolution, know where the signal is coming from because 1:1, but takes more light because 1:1 mapping, need to have the right photoreceptor stimulated, not any of a group.
