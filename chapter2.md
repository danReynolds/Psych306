# Retinal Information Processing

Retina contains 5 major classes of neurons:

Photoreceptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, ganglion cells.

Photoreceptors consist of an **outer segment**, an **inner segment**, and a **synaptic terminal**.

Visual pigment molecules are made in the inner segment, and stored in the outer. Each visual pigment molecule consists of a protein, which determines the wavelengths of light it will absorb, and a **chromosphere**, which captures light photons.

**outer segment** = the part of a photoreceptor that contains photopigment molecules.
**inner segment** = part of the photoreceptor that lies between the outer segment and the cell nucleus.
**synaptic terminal** = the location where axons terminate at the synapse for transmission of info by the release of a chemical transmitter
**chromosphere** = the light-catching part of the visual pigments of the Retina
**rhodopsin** = the visual pigment found in rods
**melanopsin** = a photopigment sensitive to ambient light
**fovea** = highest number of cones, high visual acuity, center point of fixation.

**Photoactivation** = When a photon makes its way into the outer segment of a rod and is absorbed by a molecule of rhodopsin, it transfers its energy to the chromophore portion of the visual pigment molecule

Results in inside side of outer segment getting negatively charged, called **hyperpolarization**.

We have three cone photopigments:

* S-cones: short-wave
* L-cones: long-wave
* M-cones: medium wave

2:1 ratio of L-cones to M-cones.

**Horizontal cells**: run perpendicular to the photoreceptors, form **lateral inhibition**, which enables the signals that reach retional ganglion cells to be based on differences in activation between nearby photoreceptors.

**amacrine cells**: a retinal cell found in the inner synaptic layer that makes synaptic contacts with bipolar cells, ganglion cells and other amacrine cells. Send signals to bipolar, amacrine and retinal ganglion cells.

Horizontal and amacrine cells form a lateral pathway in the retina
Photoreceptors, bipolar cells and ganglion cells form a vertical pathway
Bipolar cells are the intermediaries.

In peripheral vision, a bipolar cell receives input from as many as 50 photoreceptors, polls the info, and passes it to a ganglion cell. Not 1 to 1, less visual acuity.

The fact that rods communicate with ganglion cells through diffuse bipolar cells largely accounts for the ability of the rod system to function well in dim lighting conditions.

In the fovea, **midget bipolar cells** receive input from single cones and pass this info on to single ganglion cells. This one-to-one, cone to ganglion cell pathway only exsits in the fovea and accounts for why imgaes are most clear when they fall on this part of the retina.

Peripherals get high sensitivity to light, but poor acuity.

Each foveal cone contacts two bipolar cells:

* one reponds to an increase in light captured by a cone and is called an **ON bipolar cell**
* the other responds to a decrease and is called an **OFF bipolar cell**

Signal finally arrives at **ganglion cell**:

A retinal cell that receives visual information from photoreceptors via two intermediate neuron types, bipolar cells and amacrine cells and transmits info to the brain and midbrain. Two concentric rings, its receptive field and a surround.

Brain contains over a million ganglion cells. Midget bipolar cells send signals to small ganglion cells called **P ganglion cells**.

Diffuse bipolar cells project to ganglioncells that are called **M ganglion cells**.

Ganglion cells fire action potentials spontaneously, at about one spike per second, even in the absence of visual stimulation. Each ganglion cell has a small window on the world called its **receptive field**.

The receptive field is the region on the retina in which visual stimuli influence the neuron's firing rate.

**ON-center cell**: A cell that increases its firing rate when a light is turned on in the center of its receptive field, and decreases its firing rate when a light is turned on in the surround.

**OFF-center cell:** opposite

ON-center cell fires fastest when the size of the spot of light matches the size of the excitory center.

Retinal ganglion cells act as a filter by responding best to stimuli that are just the right size and respond worse to larger or smaller.

Most sensitive to differences in the intensity of the light in the center and the surround.

Less affected by the average intensity of the light. This is important because the average intensity of the light changes a lot, depending on if you're indoors or outdoors, night or day. But the contrast, the difference in brightness between adjacent bits will be roughly the same in all these conditions.

Ganglion, combined with bipolar, amacrine and horizontal cells act as an image filter, transforming the raw image into a new representation.

New representation highlights certain info like contrast, and discards others like ambient light intensity.

P ganglion cells have smalelr receptive fields than M.

M listen to more photoreceptors via bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine fields than P and responds to a larger portion of the visual field.

M are better at detecting visual stimuli in low-light conditions.

P respond with sustained firing with a sustained light source, M have an initial burst with first light, and then return to its normal rate.

P provide contrast in the retinal image, M provide info about how the image changes overtime.

## 4 Ways that Visual System Adapts to Changes in Illumination

1. **Pupil Size**: Pupil constricts with added light. Amount of light entering eye is proportional to area, so smaller pupil restricts total light. 16 times as many quanta can enter the pupil at its 4x size, whereas at its smallest you have 16-fold less sensitivity.

2. **Photopigment Regeneration**: Get large sensitivity range by the way photopigments are used up and replaced in receptor cells.

In dim lighting conditions, lots of photopigment is available, and rods and cones absorb and respond to as many photons as they can. Rods can detect a single quantum of light and perform better in dim light conditions.

With lots of photons present, we throw them away and use a subset.

3. Duplex Retina

Cones are less sensitive to dim light than rods but can handle far more photons/second. Up to hundreds of thousands.

Cones take over when there is too much light for rods to function well.

4. Neural Circuitry

Cells will still fire if light falls on the entire receptive field, as long as th light is brighter on the ON portion than the OFF.

## Conclusion

How the visual system deals with light has two parts:

1. The eye reduces the scale of the problem by regulating the amount of light entering the eyeball, by using different types of photoreceptors in different situations, and by throwing away photons we don't need.

2. By responding to the contrast between adjacent retinal regions, the ganglion cells do their best to ignore whatever variation in overall light is left over.
