# Music and Speech Perception

When one of two periodic sounds is double the frequency of the other, those two sounds are an octave apart.

Musical pitch is typically described as having two dimensions:

1. Tone Height: A sound quality corresponding to the level of pitch.

2. Tone Chroma: A sound quality shared by tones that have the same octave interval.

A lower octave note shares some qualities with its higher octave note.

## Absolute Pitch

A rare ability whereby some people are able to very accurately name or produce notes without comparison to other notes.

**Syncopation** = any deviation from a regular rhythm, for example, by accenting a note that is expected to be unaccented or not playing a note when it is expected.

## Speech

**Vocal Tract** = The airway above the larynx used for the production of speech. The vocal tract includes the oral tract and the nasal tract.

> Unlike other animals, the human larynx is positioned quite low in the throat. One notorious disadvantage of such a low larynx is that humans choke on food more easily than any other animal does. The fact that these life-threatening anatomical liabilities were evolutionarily trumped by the survival advantage of oral communication is a testament to the importance of language to human life.

The production of speech has 3 components:

1. Respiration in the lungs
2. Phonation, vocal folds and articulation
3. vocal tract

## Respiration and Phonation

Air is pushed out the lungs, through the trachea and up to the larynx.

At the larynx air passes through the two vocal folds which are made up of muscle tissue that can be adjusted to vary how freely air passes through the opening, this adjustment is **=phonation**.

## Articulation

The oral and nasal tract above the larynx, collectively referred to as the *vocal tract*, is manipulated in humans by changing the jaw, lips, tongue body, etc.

These manipulations are called **articulation**.

**Formant** = a resonance of the vocal tract, formants are specified by their center frequency and are denoted by integers that increases with relative frequency.

## Categorical Perception

For speech as well as other complex sounds and images, the phenomenon by which the discrimination of items is no better than the ability to label items. Listeners report hearing differences between sounds only when those differences would result in different labels for those sounds.
