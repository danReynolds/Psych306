# Space Perception and Binocular Vision

**Binocular disparity** = the differences between the two retinal images of the same world. Disparity is the basis for a vivid perception of the three-dimensionality of the world that is not available with purely **monocular** vision.

The technical term for this binocular perception of depth is binocular **stereopsis**: the ability to use ocular disparity as a cue for depth.

Having two laterally separated eyes connected to a single brain provides us with important information about depth through the geometry of the small differences between the images in each eye. These differences, known as binocular disparities, give rise to stereoscopic depth perception.

## Occlusion

A cue to relative depth order in which one object obstructs the view of part of another object.

## Linear Perspective

The rules that determine how lines in 3D-space are projected onto a two-dimensional image.

## Anamorphosis

Use of the rules of linear perspective to create a two-dimensional image so distorted that it looks correct only when viewed from a specific angle that counters the distortion.

## Motion Parallax

Motion provides a cue for depth. When moving left to right, objects that move more right than others must be closer, so that you view them passing faster. Motion has given you cues about depth.

Requires the head to move.

## Accommodation and Convergence

The eye changes its focus and lens gets fatter as we gaze towards nearer objects, this is accommodation.

Convergence is when the eyes rotate inwards to focus on a viewpoint, divergence is when they move outwards.

## Binocular Vision and Stereopsis

**Stereoscope** is a device for simultaneously providing one image to one eye and another image to the other eye.

It allows you to see depth.

## Binocular Rivalry

Competition between the two eyes for control of visual perception. Hold a finger in front of one eye, do you see the finger or see through the finger to the clock in the eye it is in front.

Horopter = a surface containing all those points who images fall on corresponding parts of the retina of the two eyes.

Panum's fusional area = region of space surrounding the horopter within which images on the two retinas can be fused.

If an object is within Panum's area, we fuse its two images into a single stereoscopic perception.

If it is outside Panum's area, we normally suppress one of the copies.

## Development of Binocular Vision and Stereopsis

Infants are essentially stereoblind before 3 months and a sudden offset of stereopsis between 3 and 5 months.

**Stereoacuity** is a measure of the smallest binocular disparity that can generate a sensation of depth.

Rises from nothing to full adult level proficiency in 4-6 months.

Extensive binocular visual experience is not necessary for binocular connections to form in V1. These connections are present at birth or very shortly after and we don't need to learn or develop binocular vision.

Random dot stereograms show that we don't need to know what we're seeing before we see it in stereoscopic depth. Binocular disparity alone can support shape perception.

The difficulty of matching an image element in one eye with the correct element in the other is known as the **correspondence problem**. The brain uses several strategies to solve this, it reduces the initial complexity of the problem by matching large **blobs** in the low spatial frequency info before trying to match high-frequency detail.

Neurons in the primary visual cortex and beyond have receptive fields that cover a region in 3d-space, not just a 2d-plane.

When the stimuli between two eyes are different, we experience a continual perceptual competition between the two eyes known as binocular rivalry. Rivalry is part of the effort to make the best guess about the current state of the world based on the current state of the input.
