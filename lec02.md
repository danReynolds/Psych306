## Percept (Quale/Qualia)

What the mind makes of the sensations (the stimulus you detect), how all those things go together to create the actual experience you had. That is a percept.

## Advancements Using Case Studies

Major advancements made through case studies. Two of the most famous are readings.

1. Phineas Gage: set off explosives that punctured his brain.

2. Henry Molson (HM): Debilitating epilepsy, memento. Cost him a decade's worth of memory, couldn't have new long-term memory.

Case study research is retrospective, cares about what actually happened that caused an injury after the fact. Often dependent on self-report, what people remember happening, their interpretation = less reliable.

## EEG

Measuring Event-Related Potentials (ERP), know exactly when it happened, can measure patterns of electrical activity non-evasively.

## MEG

Looking at neural activity in brain, good temporal resolution, better spacial resolution than an EEG. Detects magnetic changes in the brain. Takes a large amount of equipment.

## CT Scan

Computed tomography, compositive of x-ray images, can then go in and study by each slice. EEG and MEG give activity, neurons firing, in a time related to when an event happened. CT is giving the anatomy of the brain. Where someone had a bleed for example.

## MRI

Magnetic resonance imaging, checks in different orientations, looks at reactions of all the atoms of the head for example to magnetic fields.
fMRI = functional magnetic resonance imaging, used for determining which part of the brain is especially active
while doing a particular task, for example.

fMRI looks more specifically at patterns throughout the brain of blood oxygen, parts of the brain actively hard at work. Can spot a *bold* response,
a blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response.

## PsychoPhysics

Can we find measurable, quantitative relationships between a stimulus and whatever that psychological event is that is the percept, the experience
of sensing and perceiving that experience.

Psychophysics are the set of skills and techniques that go together to allow us to understand the patterns of a perceptual experience.

What's the quietest sound you can hear? What's the spiciest food you can eat?

### Two-Point Threshold

If you're stuck with two pins simultaneously, you can tell that there are two pins. The closer they get together,
the more likely you won't be able to tell them apart. That point where you can't tell is the two-point threshold.

If you're trying to understand a sensation like touch, try and figure out how far apart they have to be to discrimnate against them.

It varies according to where on the body you do it, and it is very poor on the back for example.

### Just-Noticeable Difference

Can reliably notice it 50% of the time.

### Absolute Threshold

If the sensation is below this amount, it is not felt.

Sensation intensity vs physical intensity:

Is there a linear relationship? Something different? Generally it is logarithmic.

### Weber's Law

The smallest change you can detect is a constant fraction of the stimulus level. A 5g difference in the weight of two mice is easy to detect, as it
is a large fraction of the stimulus itself, the mouse.

A 5g change between two elephants is far more difficult.

### Flashback Doctrine of Specific Energies

Poking yourself in the eye creates a visual percept, even though you aren't hitting the retina with light, you will see something because
neurons are stimulated by the poke. You're not actually seeing the red colors your eye is stimulated to see with the pain, or like stars you see after injury.

### Methods of Constant Stimulus

Standard set of levels of the stimulus, presented in a random order, do it a bunch of times.
Ranging from barely perceptible to very perceptible, randomly.

### Method of Limits

Sneaking up on things. Take a difference between two stimulus and gradually change from one to the other until it can be sensed by the person. Average it out.
Come back down the scale, from can hear to can't hear, the continuous transition.

Like optometrist, reading letters off wall.

### Method of Adjustment

Let them adjust it themselves, adjust dials until one color matches another one as best they can.

Much noisier, more individual variability. People set dials differently from others more.

### Magnitude Estimation

How much does it hurt? can you describe the pain? You estimate how bad something is. Where are you on the scale.

### Steven's Power Law

$$
S = aI^{b}
$$

How much louder follows an exponential pattern.

### How to Study?

What does JND stand for and mean?

Absolute threshold is the minimum amount of stimulation necessary to detect a stimulus 50% of the time.

Define, compare and contrast MRI and fMRI. fMRI is looking at activity, MRI is anatomy.

Which method would be better to study x and why?

### Assignment 1

Look at summary of TED talk available from the Assignment 1 description. Write a synopsis at a particular audience. Educated, but not specialists in psychology.

Be critical, doubt things that seem inaccurate. Practice searching psychological literature, find 5-10 papers published in or since 2000 related to the topic. Must be peer-reviewed journals, the TA should be able to tell it is related. Don't have to read them, just make a list. Cite the TED talk as well as 5-10 papers.

Example APA styling given, bonus marks given for 6-10.
