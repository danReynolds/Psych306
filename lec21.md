# Source Segregation

Trying to figure out how pieces of sound piece together in space and time as sources, not just locations in space.

Rules audio system uses to segregate the sources and auditory streaming:

1. Location in space:

* Separation of sounds based on location in different spaces around you.
* Separate sources that are moving from ones that are stationary.
* Separate stationary sources relative to where you are moving in a room, know one is behind you now, one is ahead of you still.

2. Spectral or Temporal Qualities

Group sounds if they share common sounds, group based on similarities in tamber, familiar sounds that we know go together.

Principle of Good Continuation: See something as continuous, do the same with sound, chunk of sound interrupted by silence, interpret it as one continuous stream. If add noise overtop of sound, can still hear it as continuous, even when it is blocked out with noise.

## Restoration

We restore missing sounds, taking info from the brain that is backfilled to make sense of missing info.

Bridge over sound interruptions, anticipate what is missing or predicted.

## Auditory Attention

Emotional state affects attention reflex, walking and driving patterns of people coming out of theatre for action movie vs other.

## Inattentional Deafness

Tune things out, caused by getting ingrained in a book etc.

## Equilibrium

Contender for another sense. Includes information about your spatial orientation, particularly the head. Helps you know which way is up.

Vestibular nerve, labyrinth, sense orientation, movement and where gravity is. The three big loops are the semi-circular canals, in three different orientations.

The fluid in the canals will loop and move creating a waving motion that tips over the hair cells as you move, and that semi-circular canal says that you're leaning one way. Others tell you how much you're leaning forward and back and others.

The actual sensory receptors are hair cells like in the cochlea.

The Utricle and the Saccule are at the base of the loops of the semi-circular canals and are not responding to tilt, but to gravity. They are flat planar things with a gelatinous surface with small bumps on it to give it more mass. These are the ear stones, stuck to the gelatinous mass, when you lean, mass distribution shifts. It can sense linear acceleration. Determines how quickly you're accelerating in space, and which way is down.

## Touch is many different senses

Sense pressure, vibration, changes in temperature, chemical damage, limb position, location and movement in space, pleasant touch.

Layers of skin:

1. Epidermis
2. Dermis
3. Subcutis

3 main properties of touch receptors:

1. Type of stimulation: What sort of stimulus actually triggers a particular receptor
2. Size of its receptive field: At sensory neuron level, some have larger receptive fields, some have smaller.
3. Adaption Speed: Some are fast adapting and some are slow adapting.

## Mechanoreception

Four types, 2 small receptive fields, one fast adapting and one slow adapting.
            2 large receptive fields, one ...

Meissner corpusles are fast, small receptive fields: pick up changes over small time intervals, because fast adapting. Pick up low frequency vibrations, maintain stable grasp.
Merkel are slow adapting, small receptive fields: good for perceiving texture and pattern of form detection, can't pick up if a surface is buzzing, but can find fine textures. Pick up small spatially, not temporally.
Pacinian are fast large receptive fields: pick up high frequency vibrations, and fine details because of large fields.
Ruffini are slow large receptive fields: sustained downward pressure, lateral skin stretch, so can feel if something is starting to slip.

Ones that are deep are in the dermis layer and are slow adapting.

## Thermoreception

Respond to temperature differences from your body temperature.

2 Kinds:

1. Thermoreceptors that respond to temperatures colder than you
2. Thermoreceptors that respond to temperatures hotter than you

## No Susception

2 groups of no susceptors:

1. Quick responding: respond to a burn or a cut or a jab with a needle. Neurons are insulated with a coating of myelin, making it easier to send signals over great length. These fibers get the word out fast, respond quickly.
2. Slow Responding: C fibers, not myelinated, don't have insulation, now get throbbing pain after the initial first sharp pain.


## Pruriception

Itchiness starts with certain receptors.

## Pleasant Touch

Different C-fibers, not related to pain or itch reception, respond to slow-moving, lightly applied touch. Touch receptors entirely dedicated to knowing when you're being petted.

Signal from these receptors are not processed in same area of the brain as the other sensory receptors, processed in the orbital frontal cortex rather than S1 and S2 where other sensory info comes together.

## Kinesthesia

How we use touch perception to understand body position and action. Many receptors we use to record this are internal, not on skin. Position of limbs and how they are moving in space without visual information.

Mechanoreceptors that are in muscles and tendons and joints. Muscle spindles are another thing, tension gauges on a muscle that tells you hold flexed or relaxed it is, like a spring.

## Proprioception

Whole body perspective of where you are, takes limb and other perception into account

## Somatosensation

Takes collective sensation from limbs, skin etc and brings it all together.
