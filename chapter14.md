# Taste

When we chew and swallow foods, molecules are released into the air inside our mouths and forced up behind the palate into the nasal cavity where they contact the olfactory epithelium and stimulate our olfactory receptors.

The brain combines these retronasal olfactory sensations with our taste sensations to create **flavor**.

## Localizing Food Sensations

**chorda tympani** = branch of cranial nerve that carries taste info from the tongue. It exits the tongue and passes info through the middle ear on its way to the brain.

**cranial nerves** = twelve pairs of nerves that carry info from taste receptors to the brain.

## Physiology of the Gustatory System

Chewing breaks down food substances into molecules which are dissolved in saliva. The saliva-borne food molecules flow into a taste pore that leads to **taste buds** that are located in structures called **papillae**.

**Taste buds** = a globular cluster of cells that has the function of creating neural signals conveyed to to the brain by the taste nerves. The tips of taste buds are called microvelli. Sites on the microvelli contain two groups:

1. Ion channels that mediate responses to salts and acids

2. G protein-coupled receptors that bind to sweet and bitter compounds

**Papillae** = The structures that give the tongue its bumpy appearance, located mostly on the edges of the tongue in a rough oval.

Taste buds contain multiple **taste receptor cells** each of which respond to a limited number of molecule types.

When it comes in contact with one of its preferred molecules, the taste receptor cell produces action potentials that send info along one of the cranial nerves to the brain.

## Papillae

There are 4 types of papillae:

1. **Filiform papillae** = the ones without any taste function, located on the front of the tongue.

2. **Fungiform papillae** = resemble tiny button mushrooms, also located on the front of the tongue. Visible to the naked eye, about six taste buds in each fungiform papilla.

3. **Foliate papillae** = located on the back of the tongue, look like series of folds containing taste buds.

4. **Circumvallate paillae** = form an inverted V on the rear of the tongue.

Taste buds are also distributed in a line across the roof of the mouth in addition to an oval formed by the filiform and fungiform at the front and foliate and circumvallate at the back.

## Taste Buds and Taste Receptor Cells

Taste bud cells fall into three different groups with different functions:

1. Type 1: housekeeping cells that excrete potassium through the taste pore allowing other cell types to maintain their resting membrane potential.

2. Type 2: Receptor cells that tend to respond to only one of sweet, bitter, or umami stimuli.

3. Type 3: presynaptic cells, may also play a role in sour taste.

Taste receptors are short-living, die and remade within days. Enables taste system to recover from damage and explains why taste remains robust into old age.

Two mechanisms for recognizing a taste stimulus by the taste cell called **tastants**:

1. Type 1: Made up of small, charged molecules that taste salty or sour. Small openings caclled *ion channels* in microvillus membranes allow the charged particles to enter the cell but restrict others.

When the charged particles in salty and sour foods enter salty and sour receptor cells, these cells signal their respective tastes.

2. Type 2: Produce sensations that we label as sweet or bitter. When a particular tastant molecule *key* fits into the *lock* portion of a G protein-coupled receptor (GCPR) on the outside of the membrane, the portion of the GPCR inside the cell starts a cascade of molecular events ultimately causing an action potential to be sent to the brain.

## Taste Processing in the Central Nervous System

After leaving taste buds, gustatory info travels through way stations into the medulla and thalamus before reaching the **insular cortex**, the primary cortical processing area for taste.

**orbitofrontal cortex** = receives projections from the insular cortex. Some orbitofrontal neurons are multimodal, responding to temperature, touch and smell as well as taste, suggesting it to be an integration area of the senses.

## The Four Basic tastes

Salty, sour, bitter, sweet

1. Salty: Comes from salts, NACL etc.

2. Sour: Comes from acids, hydrogen ion concentration.

3. Bitter: 25 bitter genes on chromosomes, there are thousands of bitter molecules to detect coming from plants, etc. 25 types of bitter receptors do the job responding to specific compounds, etc.

Sweet and bitter tastes inhibit one another. So bitter drinks like tonic water or cranberry juice contains a surprising amount of sugar because of the offset required to counter the bitterness.

We have multiple bitter receptors to encompass the chemical diversity of poisons, but they all feed into common lines leading to rejection.

4. Sweet: Comes from sugars, some useless sugars have similar structures to the ones we want like glucose and fructose so our receptors need to differentiate between them.

## Genetic Variation in Bitter

**nontaster** = An individual born unable to taste certain compounds like PROP because they have two recessive genes. They don't taste the bitter from these compounds.

**taster** = An individual born with one or more dominant genes and able to taste these compounds. Find it bitter.

**supertaster** = taster who also has a high density of fungiform papillae and therefore taste buds. Find it really bitter.

Tasters are more finicky eaters because bitter tastes are more intense and they dislike those foods more readily.

Alcoholics and smokers have low proportions of tasters, given that they are able to endure the bitterness of these substances.

## Supertasters

Bitterness grows more slowly with concentration than sweet does. Cross modality matching of bitter taste sensations to other modalities like pain sensations allowed researchers to classify supertasters.

Those with the most numerous fungiform papillae experience the most intense taste sensations in general, such as oral burn from chili peppers, and oral touch from fats or thickeners in foods.

Taste buds are surrounded by pain fibers so supertasters perceive a greater burn from chilis than nontasters. Additionally, fungiform papillae, the structures that house taste buds are triggered by touch fibers, therefore supertasters perceive greater touch sensations from fats, creamy, thick foods.

Removing input from one of the taste nerves can actually intensify taste sensations because different inputs inhibit one another.

But when damage is widespread, taste perception necessarily diminishes.

## Health Consequences of Taste Sensation

Some vegetables produce pleasant bitter sensations to medium tasters and supertasters, leading these individuals to eat fewer of them. Reduced vegetable intake is a risk factor for cancer.

Fats can also produce unpleasantly intense sensations in supertasters, leading them to eat fewer high-fat foods and lowing their risk of cardiovascular disease.

These sensory links to behavior that affects health are not limited to diet. Nontasters are more likely to smoke and consume alcohol.

Bitter and sour systems reject any highly bitter or acidic tastes, while sweet and salty enable us to detect and selectively ingest foods that our bodies need.

**Specific hungers theory** = the idea that deficiency of a given nutrient produces craving for that nutrient. Cravings for salty or for sweet are associated with deficiencies in those substances, however it doesn't work for other substances like vitamins.

**sensory specific satiety** = eat a variety of foods because they got bored eating single foods.

If we experience nausea after eating, the brain makes us dislike the sensory properties of the foods (conditional food aversions). We regular our intake through a combination of hardwired basic tastes and learned responses to flavoured foods.

## Umami

Umami is the taste sensation from MSG and was a candidate for a fifth basic taste as part of advertising claims by manufacturers of MSG.

But umami lacks one of the most important properties of a basic taste: hardwired affect. SOme individuals like umami, some do not.

Also protein molecules are too large to stimulate taste or olfaction. MSG is part of a protein molecule, but most proteins in the mouth are not broken down.

Protein molecules are too large to be sensed by taste or smell but proteins are made up of amino acids including glutamic acid.

When eaten, proteins are broken down into their constituent amino acids, providing stimuli for the glutamate receptors in the gut, not the mouth.

Consuming food with MSG creates a preference for the flavor, while simply holding the food in the mouth does not. This allows many proteins that do not taste like Umami to evoke pleasure, not hardwired like the main 4 tastes, but learned pleasure.

MSG is a neurotransmitter, so concerns raised. MSG in large doses may be a problem for some sensitive individuals, but apparently it does not present a serious problem for the general population.

## Special Case of Fat

Fat is a very important nutrient. Fat molecules are too large to stimulate either taste or olfaction, like proteins. Fat in the gut produces conditioned preferences for the sensory properties of the food containing the fat.

## Nature of Taste Qualities

**Labeled lines** = a theory of taste coding in which each taste nerve fiber carries a particular taste quality. For example, the quality evoked from a sucrose-best fiber is sweet, that from an NCL-best fiber is salty, etc.

Color vision and olfaction use pattern encoding, a single type of cone cannot tell us the wavelength of a light ray, but the pattern of activity across our three cone types give us info.
Hearing uses a mechanism like the labeled-line approach, certain neurons always respond to certain frequencies, regardless of the combo being sent at it. Spots what it cares about in a mixture of frequencies. This is what taste does.

But in smell we can have combinations of compounds that produce a new smell sensation, whose components cannot be identified. Like how perfumes its hard to figure out its constituent parts.
But for taste, poisonous plants contain components with a variety of tastes. If bitterness were to mix with other tastes and we could not pick out the bitterness, we would die.

We are much better at analyzing taste mixtures than smell mixtures.

In cranberry juice, we taste the sweet and the bitter. In pattern encoding theory, opposite to labeled lines, then it would be encoded by a different pattern because of the combo and this would result in a new pattern and a new taste.

So while olfaction is pattern encoding, taste is labeled lines like hearing frequencies.

Cross-adaptation: lemonade tastes sour after a sweet dessert, adapt to some tastes, temporarily adapt to perceive others differently.

## Chili Peppers

We are not born liking Chili peppers. Depends on social influences.

Rat eats it, other rats agree to it pepper. Social influence.

Burn from eating chili peppers varies between people because of two sources:

1. Individuals with largest fungiform papillae, the supertasters, have the most fibers mediating pain and perceive the most intense oral burn.

2. Capsaicin, a chemical that produces the burn from the chilis desensitizes pain receptors. Individuals who eat chilis often become chronically desensitized.

Desensitization occurs during the decline of the burn. So eat something spicy, then stop. Then once the initial burn has faded, the rest of the meal should be easier. **dont keep eating** as you wont get the fade and won't desensitize.
