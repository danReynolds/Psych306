## Pinnae

The part that you decorate and hangs off the ear. Its length and shape is enhancing sounds.

## Tympanic Membrane

Eardrum, thin sheet of skin at base of ear canal.

## Amplification vs Acoustic Reflex

Created by 3 bones in middle ear hinged together.

Stapes has larger surface area.

Inside of cochlea is filled with fluid, transfers sound faster, takes more energy.

## Inner Ear

Round window is a pressure valve, releasing and leftover waveform after going into the spiral and out of spiral.

## Cochlea

Spiral shape, but think of it as having been unspiralled, concicle thing with canals along it.

## Rate Saturation

A particular nerve fiber is firing as fast as is physically possible. Peaked.

How do we deal with stimuli beyond that? Losing selectivity. Have auditory nerve fibers of different reactivity and spotaneity. High, medium and low, all synapse on same hair cells. Some are touchy, go off really fast. Some respond mid range and some require a lot of stimulus to get going. Spread the workload over the different fibers, all synapsing onto the same hair cell, so some are touchier, max out and hit saturation, some won't fire off as early, but then more room for signalling even at max rate. Teamwork approach.

Ceiling on how responsive nerd fiber can be.
