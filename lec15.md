# Efficiency

## Salient features

features that pop out like color.

## Parallel searching

We can search for certain features in parallel, like looking for a particular color and orientation.

Processing multiple stimuli at the same time.

## No Basic Feature Info

Inefficient search, like looking for a button with colored dots, not a basic feature that pops out so processing takes much longer.

## Conjunction Search

need more than one property to be present, looking for multiple properties.

## Illusory Conjunctions

might be processing of features independently, orientation or color that are then bound together after.

Look at colored letters and recall ones that weren't there, combined things incorrectly.


## RSVP: Rapid Serial Visual Presentation

Show people a series of things in order fast. Expose certain ways that attention behaves or falls apart over time.

## Attentional Blink

Your attention blinked, shortly after seeing first target, for a short period of time, miss another matching target, approximately 200-500ms after first target.

first person shooters reduce people's attentional blink.

## Visual field Defect

hurt part of visual cortex, people can't see a part of the visual field.

## Disorders of Visual Attention

Some people can have extinguishes such that cant split attention to two points. Present of other stimulus has extinguished awareness of another one.

Depends on which side the brain damage is on.

Extinction is a modest version of neglect.

Neglect is a disorder that happens in the right side of the parietal lobe. Disorder of attention, inability to attend to left space. Contralateral.

Their eyes work fine, no visual field deficit. Still have good vision, just cannot attend to it.

If they draw a copy of a scene, omit features on the left side of the scene.
