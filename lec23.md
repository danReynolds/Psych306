# The "Where" System

Egocenter is the center for any frame of reference relative to your body. You're trying to locate objects in space centered around you.

## Interaction Between Modalities

Deceive participants to anticipate one modality, like anticipating touch, but then present a sound instead. They would check to see responses to cues across different sensory modalities. The hardest cues to unexpectedly deal with are when you expect to be touched but got an auditory or visual cue instead.

Asked how rough is the surface of the sandpaper or how closely packed are the elements on the surface of the paper. They ask the same thing in one way that is touch focused and another that is a visual question. Result was a compromise of the two different modalities.

## Smell

Odour is the percept you get, the translation of a chemical stimulus into a sensation of smell. Odourants are your stimuli, one of the molecules that the olfactory system senses and translates into odour. There are things we can't smell, need certain characteristics:

* Volatile
* Small
* Hydrophobic

Basal cells become olfactory sensory neurons. Olfactory epithelium is constantly replenishing its stockpile of sensory neurons.

Glomerulus is where we start looking for patterns across the different receptors.

## Binaral Rivalry

We experience smells from each nostral one at a time, not blended together or combined in some way.

## Olfaction and Emotion

Odours triggered by memory have a distinct emotion attached to them. Olfactory sensory processing is in same system that deals with emotion.

You can get a somatosensory response from an odour, so menthol can make you feel cool. Similarly, ammonia creates a burning sensation in addition to smell. You can feel smell.

## Shape Pattern Theory

Identify smell based on shape of molecules and geometry of construction, patterns of construction.

## Vibration Theory

Any particular molecule has its own frequency and everything vibrating at the same frequency smells the same. Unproven.

## Specific Anosmia

Particular compound that you cannot smell. There is a compound like this that 20-40% cannot smell. This is a molecule found in armpit sweat and pork.

## StereoIsomers

Smell different from one another, different shape but same composition, mirror image of a different molecule that smells different.

## Staircase Method

How much odour do you need to expose to someone until they can detect it. Walk up the stairs until they can detect it, then back down until they cannot, find the threshold.

## Triangle Test

How small of a discrepancy can we discriminate between. Cannot expose someone to a lot of different odours, we adapt quickly to odours.

## Tip of the Nose Phenomenon

Smelt something before but just can't quite remember what it is. We don't have good access to language associated with odour. We don't have as many smell words as we do for other sensory experiences. Our ability to identify and name odours is tied to naming things.

We can detect over a trillion smells, 7.5 million colours. Dogs have 100x our limit, more of the brain dedicated to smell processing.

## Olfaction and Individual Differences

Women generally have more sensitive sense of smell than men.

## A Synthetic Sense

Olfaction is a synthetic sense, we almost never sense pure odourants, we get mixtures and experience those as such. Analytic analysis is like hearing, can pick out music you hear into component pieces. Colours are synthetic, can stare at green all day but not break it into yellow and blue, its components, you instead experience a synthetic result.

Olfaction is similarly a synthetic experience, mostly experiencing it as a mixture, a synthetic thing.

Some ability to pick out individual components of a smell is possible and can be trained, but not prevalent.

## Change Detection

After a while in a situation, stop noticing odourants that have been available for a long time. Will notice changes.


## Attention in Olfaction

You cannot smell when asleep, there is a role of attention in olfaction.

## Olfaction Influences Vision

One image with markers vs one image with a rose. You switch which one they're seeing and if you expose them to the smell of markers, they're more likely to detect the marker image, vs if you expose smell of roses, image of roses wins (in binocular rivalry, each eye gets an image, brain can only process one at a time, one it picks to analyze "wins")

## Olfactory White

So much noise in olfactory whites that we cannot smell them, cannot pick up any identifiable components. Bacon has certain components that we can identify, it isn't all of the spectrum of smells, just components of it, and we identify it. An olfactory white has too much of different components and we can't pick it up to specifically be anything, too much noise to particularly identify anything.

## Pheromones

Some animals have a chemical sensing organ at the base of the nasal cavity, detecting molecules that cannot be detected by the epithelium, and this category of molecules is picked up there. Pheromones trigger a physiological or behavioural response to other members of the same species, like paths to food sources etc. non-hydrophobic, so can't be picked up by nose.

In humans, call them chemosignals, exotic dancers get more tips when they're ovulating because they are perceived as more attractive, no visual information, believe it is a chemical signal picked up by the nose.

Women who live together can synchronize menstrual cycles, may be chemosignalling as well.
