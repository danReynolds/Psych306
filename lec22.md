## Somatotopic Organization

All of the sensation from the skin and receptors coming in to the spinal column come in at some appropriate height to the spinal column and all the way up to the brain.

Fast and slow spinal pathways:

1. Spinothalamic pathway is slower, can afford to wait if we're too hot or cold.

2. Dorsal Column Medial Lemniscal Pathway gives information quickly, related to pain etc.

Regions of the body are mapped onto regions of S1 and S2, the Primary and Secondary somatosensory cortexes.

## Phantom Limb

Still have intermittent sensation in a missing limb, often pain.

## Neural Plasticity

Ability of neurons to undergo changes as a result of activity. Actual reorrganization of neural circuits. Blindfolded participants for 5 days, tested their tactile sensitivity to brale. Scanned them in an fMRI.

Checked patterns of activation in the cortex. On the 5th day, S1 is activated after touching brale, will activate from any kind of sensation, but it had decreased by the 5th day, while V1 had increased, the visual cortex.

In just 5 days of exposure to brale, reorganization of brain activation that is attending to brale from the sensory cortex to the visual cortex. Visual cortex is doing analysis on a sensory input.

Violinists have a larger section for the playing hand than the holding hand.

## Pain is a Percept

It is subjective, what you make out of input you get from a stimulus. Emotional response to painful stimuli are moderated by anticipation, religious belief, prior experience, by excitement.

Analgesia: Decreasing of pain experienced while conscious. This can include battle pain mitigation.

Neurotransmitters involved to create that effect, moderate the painful stimulus, can create similar effects with other opiates.

## Gate Control Theory

Use pressure, cold, or another pain to mitigate an initial pain. Gate the one pain, allow another stimuli to focus attention.

Only so much information you can get at once, and applying cold or pressure takes up some of that, reducing the amount of pain information you receive.

## Hyperalgesia

After there has been damage to the skin, everything in that site can become hypersensitive to pain.

## Neuropathy

Damage nerves, get signal that might feel like you have a hand on a hot stove, but that is a damaged nerve, not a representation of an actual stimulus.

Treatment of chronic pain is very difficult for this reason. The pain may be coming from the stimulation of any number of receptors, but damage to the nerves themselves can cause pain, hard to make go away.

## Tactile Sensitivity

How sensitive we are to mechanical pressure. Can gauge it by determining the smallest bump that you can distinguish on a smooth surface.

We can detect a bump 10 nano metres high.

## Tactile Acuity

How close can two stimuli be and still be differentiable.

## Temporal Acuity

Senses have temporal acuity, vision cannot tell above 24fps that these are discrete frames, looks continuous.

Touch has 5ms temporal acuity in touch, whereas vision is relatively poor acuity.

## Haptic Perception

Your understanding of the world from the sensory receptors, skin, muscles, joints, that typically involve active exploration of the properties of the world around you. Need to be able to put your hands on it, etc, haptic perception can help you get material properties of an object when you touch it for example.

## Fingerprints

amplify signal that you can pick up for fine texture.

## Haptic Search

Certain properties pop, like bumps along smooth, edged surface where rest is smooth, cold thing among a bunch of warm things.
