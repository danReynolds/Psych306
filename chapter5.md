# The Perception of Color

The perception of color is broken into 3 steps:

1. Detection: Wavelengths must be detected.
2. Discrimination: We must be able to tell the difference between one wavelength and another.
3. Appearance: We want perceived colors to be attached to an object and not change dramatically with the viewing conditions, like shadow or angle.

## Step 1: Color Detection

Photoreceptors and all that, covered in chapter 2.

## Step 2: Color Discrimination:

We can detect wavelengths between 400nm and 700nm. Different levels of response are produced by photoreceptors based on the wavelength. The varying responses of photoreceptors to different wavelengths can provide a basis for color vision.

But this doesn't work because it is a parabola and there are two points for the nm values, on other ends of the spectrum. Additionally, intensity of the light influences the response, so show one color at one intensity and another at a different intensity and suddenly we make different colors. Not true. Therefore the output of a single photoreceptor is ambiguous.

This constraint is called the **Principle of Univariance**.

All rods contain the same type of photopigment, rhodopsin. Therefore they all have the same sensitivity wavelength and rods are color blind.

Dim light stimulates only the rods and this is why under dim light we see things less vividly, less colourfully.

## Trichromatic solution

The combined signal produced by analyzing a wavelength by the S, M, and L cones in combination creates a 3-tuple that forms the basis of color vision.

Together, we get a relationship, S has some value, M has some value and L has some value. We define our colors based on the relative S, M, L values , not the absolute values. Now if we change the intensity, there will still be the same relationship between the cones, since all intensities changed equally and we can still discriminate the unique color.

This is the **trichromatic theory of color vision**.

## Metamers

Objects we observe are reflecting wide ranges of wavelengths. Our cones respond to mixtures of light by exciting certain receptors with different responses. If M, S and L responses are the same for different combinations of light, then the different combinations that produce the same responses are called metamers.

The single wavelength that produces equal M and L cone activity will look yellow, and the correct mixture of longer and shorter wavelengths that creates the same M and L activity must also look yellow.

## Sending to the Brain

Computing differences between cone responses is best way to transmit info to brain. Nervous system computes L-M, gives info about color.

## Keep Track of Day and Night

The primary force adjusting your internal **circadian rhythmn** when you switch time zones is sunlight. There is a special photoreceptor in the retina that produces its own photopigment, melanopsin, which detects light and allows blind people born without rods or cones to see.

## Opponent Colors

Red and green are in some ways, opposed to eachother. We can have a reddish yellow = orange, or a bluish red = purple, but a reddish green isn't a thing.

Opponent Color Theory creates two opposing pairs:

red versus green
blue versus yellow

This was expanded on with hue cancellation. We can cancel a greenish-blue by adding its opposite, red, to produce just the blue.

**Double opponent cell** = found in visual cortex, excited by redder hues in the center and greener hues in the surround.

**Single opponent cell** = does not discriminate between center and surround, does best when all red for example, if red excites it.

Best case for specialized brain areas for color in humans come from cases of **achromatopsia**, a loss of color vision after brain damage. Patients may be able to find the boundaries between regions of different colors but cannot report what those colors are.

Qualia = technical name for the subjective aspect of experiences like color, taste, or itch.

If for you a certain object produced the quale of red, and for another it produced the quale of green, then you've learned to call them the same but are seeing different things.

**Anomia** = inability to name colors.

**Color assimilation** = In color assimilation, two colors bleed into each other, each taking on some of the chromatic quality of the other. Yellow squares can look red given proximity to red.

**Color contrast** = the color of one region induces the opponent color in a neighbouring region. A red background can make a green foreground look more green, while a green background makes a red foreground look more red.

## Adaptation and Afterimages

Color contrast effects show how the spatial relations between colors can influence color appearance. What you saw before has an influence on the color you see now. Adapting to a bright light makes a moderate light look darker.

Same works with color, stare at gray, then at red and back to gray and the gray will look different because of how you adapted to the red. Cones will be more stimulated/adapted than others.

## Color Constancy

Tendency of colors of objects to appear relatively unchanged despite substantial changes in the lighting conditions. The visual system gets some result of the surface and illuminant, IxS and is pretty good at figuring out S without I.

We have constraints that help us distinguish shadow effects, from color changes to help with color constancy.

## What is Color Vision Good For

Eating and sex. Having color vision makes it easier to find candidate foods and to discriminate good food from bad food. Finding fruits and vegetables that are ripe can be helped by color vision.

Flowers are designed to attract bees and have colors too short wavelength for humans but great for bees.

With mating, colourful display attracts mates.

**Additive Color mixture** = two or more lights are mixed. Adding a light that looks blue to a light that looks yellow produces a light that looks white.

**Subtractive Color mixture** = filters, paints, or other pigments that absorb some wavelengths and reflect others are mixed. Mixing a typical blue paint and a typical yellow paint will subtract most long and short wavelengths from the light reflected by the mixture and the result will look green.

Cones sensitive to long wavelengths are combined with cones sensitive to medium wavelengths to get an (L-M) process that is roughly sensitive to the redness or greenness of a region.

(L+M) cones are matched against short wavelength (S) cones to create a process roughly sensitive to the blueness or yellowness of a region.
