## LGN Lateral Geniculate Nucleus

At the **optic chiasm**, left visual space goes to the right side and right visual space goes to the left side, so that you get both on each side.

**Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)**

**Optic Raditations** = Fan of neurons that go from the LGN to the back of the head to the cortex. This is V1, the primary visual cortex, or the **striate cortex**.

**Contralateral** = happens on opposite side, against side. If something happens in left visual field, the neural activations in the visual cortex will be on the contralateral side.

**Ipisalateral** = if something happens on the same side, like a brain injury and symptom which appear on the same side.

**Retinatopy** = as I look at two people side-by-side, the info about those side-by-side pieces of info will be handle by neighbouring neurons. Info stays adjacent from retinal to the LGN and then to the primary visual cortex. Things you see close together are processed in the cortex close together.

### Visual Acuity

A center-surround cell could be specialized to detect a stripe of a certain frequency.
It could look for stripes of 1 degree frequency, where the contrasts fall on the center-surround and excite it.

**Contrast sensitivity function (CSF)**: makes more sense the way she presented it, maps frequency of stripes against contrast, with decrease contrast and increasing frequency, gives a hill shape. At high frequency, still visible at high contrast along x-axis for a while, while going up with less contrast, it becomes harder as we get higher frequency. Also at too low frequency it becomes harder, so overall a hill shape.

**Lateral geniculate Nucleus**:

Shaped like a layer of pancakes drooped over a pole.

Bottom two layers are getting signal from the m-cells that respond best from big fast moving things, temporal objects, data from rods in retina. Top 4 layers are getting signal from the p-cells, respond to very fine spatial detail of stationary objects, data from cones in fovia.

V1 = Striate Cortex = Primary Visual Cortex

LGN Likes spots, looks for spots.

Striate Cortex like bars. Interprets signal from neighbouring LGN neurons to see if spots line up to form stripes or bars.

## V1 Neurons: Simple, Compex and Hypercomplex

Simple Cortical cell, specializes in responding to a particular stripe of light, in a particular orientation.

Complex cortical cell, compounds more information. Complex cells have boundaries like the simple ones.

4 LGN cells, receptive fields overlap such that you can have light hit them in a line to make an excited stripe, a stripe of activation from the LGN that can be interpretted together to determine what is around you.

The orientation of the lines matter. There's an ideal orientation of a stripe that a particular cell will respond to strongest.

We have found specialized cortical cells for moving lines, bars, gratings, edges things and certain directions of motion. Not all 360 degrees, but about 30 degree intervals.

A **Simple cortical cell** can respond to: edges, stripes

A **Complex cortical cell** has a better ability to respond to stimuli so can do more stripes at different positions, but not at different orientations compared to simple cortical cells.

**End stopping** = length of stripes may activate or de-activate different cortical cells.

## V1 Cells as Filters

### Columnar Organization

The striate cortex is stripey, those stripes of the cortex have layers, and the straight path going down in the layers of the striate cortex will all be responsive to the same path of the visual field. The neurons underneath each layer form a column that is detecting information about one particular patch of the visual field.

A nearby column is all going to be detecting visual information about a nearby patch of the visual field, because of the topographic mapping of the cortex from the visual field.

These columns are clustered into groups. A group of these columns in the striate cortex is a **hypercolumn**, dedicated to looking at the properties of that particular visual field.

Half of the hyper column is processing info from visual field of the left retina, another half is processing it from the right retina, and it knows where it got it from, left eye or right eye.

Besides those are the CO blobs, specialize in interpretting color information from that particular visual processing area.

## Cortical Magnification

There is a visual field mapped onto the back of the brain, and this visual field gets magnified differently from the info in the retina to the back of the brain, the cortex.

The visual field from the fovea gets blown up in the cortex. The rest is not nearly as blown up from the retina. Far less cortical processing for the periphery, magnify the visual field from the fovea for better analysis in the cortex using cortical magnification.

## Visual Crowding

If things in the peripherals are busy, it is much harder to detect a stimulus. Harder to see something in the corner of your eye if lots of stuff going on in the corner. Haven't dedicated proportional cortical resources for the periphery. We can notice one intruder in the periphery, but won't notice one intruder in a group of 10 in the periphery, where we would if we were looking at the group with our fovea containing the group versus the periphery.

This is a consequence of cortical magnification.

## Middle vision

Striate cortex analyzes the shape, speed, direction of motion of object using columns of stripes and blobs, and size of blobs and bars, but doesn't know what they are yet.

We are now at middle vision, moving on from the striate cortex.
