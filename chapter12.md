## Tactile Receptors

A tactile receptor consists of a nerve fiber and an associated expanded ending.

All tactile nerve fibers fall into a myelinated class called **A-beta fibers**, sensory nerve fibers that transmit signals from mechanical stimulation.

There are 4 types of tactile receptors found in the skin:

1. SA (Slow Adaption, Merkel) 1: Small receptive fields and slow adaptation rates. Respond best to steady downward pressure, fine spatial detail, very low-frequency vibrations. Used for texture perception and pattern recognition.

2. SA (Slow Adaptation, Ruffini) 2: Respond to sustained downward pressure, especially lateral stretching of the skin. Used for finger position based on stretching on skin.

3. FA (Fast Adaptation, Meissner) 1: Respond to low frequency vibrations, help with slipping across skin, like a cup sliding through your fingers.

4. FA (Fast Adaptation, Pacinian) 2: Respond to high-frequency vibrations, such as a mosquito landing on your arm. Or when you tap the pencil in your hand on the table and you feel the pencil vibrate.

## Thermoreceptors

Record changes in skin temperatures.

**Warm fibers**: fire when the temp of the skin surrounding the fiber rises.

**Cold fibers**: More common, fire in response to decrease in skin temperature.

## Pain

Pain begins with signals from **nociceptors**, touch receptors that respond to painful input like extreme heat or pressure.

## Pleasure

**C Tactile (CT) Afferent** are narrow-diameter, unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers that transmit signals from pleasant touch.

## Kinesthetic Receptors

Lie within muscles, tendons and joins and play an important role in sensing where our limbs are and what kinds of movements we're making.

The angle formed by a limb at a joint is perceived through muscle receptors called **muscle spindles**.

Without these receptors, cannot move without looking at location of body parts.

## From Skin to Brain

**Dorsal horn** = Region at the rear of the spinal cord that receives inputs from receptors in the skin.

Once in the spinal cord, touch info process upward toward the brain via two major pathways:

1. **Spinothalamic Pathway** = slower of the two and carries most of the info from thermoreceptors and nociceptors.

2. **Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscal Pathway (DCML)** = includes wider-diameter axons and fewer synapses, and therefore conveys info more quickly. Info carried along this pathway is used for planning and executing rapid movements, where quick feedback is required.

Info reaches thalamus, up to the cortex into **somatosensory area 1 S1**.

S1 communicates with S2 which lies in the upper bank of the lateral sulcus and with other cortical areas. Touch sensations are represented in S1 **somatotopically**, mapping adjacent areas on the skin to adjacent areas in the brain.

If an amputee's left arm is missing, sporadic activity can continue in the area of the amputee's right S1 corresponding to the arm, leading to the perception of phantom limb.

The face region in S1 is near the hand and arm regions, so the region for an amputated arm can be stimulated by touching the face.

**Neural Plasticity** = ability of neural circuits to undergo changes in function or organization as a result of previous activity. Can not see objects for a long time, and then see them and quickly learn to associate touch with visual objects.

## Pain Continued

**Gate control theory** = Description of the pain-transmitting system that incorporates modulating signals from the brain. The bottom-up pain signals from the nociceptors can be blocked via a circuit located in the spinal cord.

Neurons in the dorsal horn inhibit pain transmission and what is transmitted to the somatosensory areas in the brain is the combined output of pain excitation from the nociceptors and this inhibition.

Gate control theory gets its name from the idea that the transmission of the pain acts like a gate that is pushed open by excitatory pain signals but closed by inhibitory inputs.

## Moderating Pain

Conscious pain relief is called **analgesia**. Counterirritation, like extreme pressure, cold or other stimulation applied to another site distance from the source of the pain can work.

The analgesic effect of battle mentality, where pain is ignored, is probably caused by **endogenous opiates**, chemicals released by the body that block the release or uptake of neurotransmitters necessary to transmit pain sensations to the brain.

Externally produced substances like morphine, heroin, and codeine are similar to these.

Other drugs like ibuprofen alleviate pain at its source by counteracting chemicals that would otherwise start the nociceptors from firing.

The **placebo effect** is the reduction of pain when people think they're taking an analgesic drug but not actually doing so.

## Pain Sensitization

**Hyperalgesia** = an increased or heightened response to a painful stimulus as a result of a site becoming more sensitive.

Reflects an increased or heightened response to a normally painful stimulus.

The resulting pain is *inflammatory*, and the heightened pain sensitivity usually goes away once the tissue heals.

## Tactile Acuity

One approach to measuring sensitivity is to ask what the smallest raised element is that we can feel as an otherwise completely smooth surface is passed over the skin.

**two-point touch thresholds** = smallest separation at which we can tell that we're being touched by two points.

Spatial acuity varies across the body.

We perform best on the two-point threshold where the density of receptors is high and the receptive fields are small, and cortical convergence does not occur.

## Haptic Perception

Refers to perceptual processing of inputs from multiple sensory subsystems, including those in skin, muscles, tendons and joints.

### Perception for action

Using our hands to actively explore the world of surfaces and objects outside our bodies is **action for perception**.

Using somatosensation to control our impressive ability to grasp and manipulate objects in a stable and highly coordinated manner and to maintain proper posture and balance involves **perception for action**.

### Action for Perception

Each exploratory procedure is optimal for obtaining precise details about one or two specific properties.

Lateral motion, for example, is the best way to explore how rough an object is.

## Role of Fingerprints in Perception and Action

fingerprint ridges help our fingers maintain a stable grasp on objects by increasing the amount of friction between our ridged skin and the object.

## Perceiving Patterns with the Skin

Pattern perception by touch is not terribly efficient, but it can be done. Especially if the patterns are small enough to be perceived by a single fingertip.

## Tactile Agnosia

The inability to identify objects by touch caused by lesions of the parietal lobe.

## Haptic Object Localization

Requires that we establish a frame of reference. The **egocenter** is the center of a reference frame used to represent locations relative to the body.

## Tactile Spatial Attention

When people anticipate being touched in a particular location, they can voluntarily direct their attention to that location. Attention that is directed to the tactile modality in this way is called **endogenous** or top-down control.

A precue, like a visual stimulation of where a physical stimulation will occur next leads to faster deciding whether a stimulus was sustained or pulsed. Precues can speed up response times.

**exogenous spatial attention** = bottom up processing, spatial attention is involuntarily directed toward the site at which a stimulus has abruptly appeared.

## Social Touch

After reading loving messages from people close to them, people felt physically warmer. Similarly, holding a heated pack led to heightened feelings of social connection.

Activation by both physical warmth and loving messages are found in common brain areas, including the insula, an area associated with positive touch-related experiences.
