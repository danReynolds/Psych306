# Spatial Vision

## Visual resolution acuity:

Eye doctors specify acuity in terms like 20/20, but vision scientists prefer to talk about the smallest visual angle of a cycle of the grating we can perceive.

A **cycle** is one repetition of a black and a white stripe

**Visual angle** is the angle that would be formed by lines going from the top and bottom of a cycle the page, passing through the center of the lens and ending in the retina.

To get this angle, take the arctangent of the cycle length, opposite, and the viewing distance, adjacent.

Under ideal conditions, humans with very good vision can resovle gratings like the ones in the textbook when one cycle subtends at an angle of aout 0.017 degree.

This resolution acuity is one of the fundamental limits of spatial vision.

The limit is determined by the spacing of photoreceptors in the retina.

If receptors are spaced such that the whitest and blackest parts of the grating fall on separate cones, we should be able to make out the grating. But if the entire cycle falls on a single cone, we will see nothing but a gray field.

Cones in the fovea have a center-to-center separation of about **0.008 degrees**. Which fits nicely with the observed acuity limit of 0.017 degrees.

Rods and cones in the periphery are packed less tightly, and more rods than cones. As a result, visual acuity is poorer in the periphery than the fovea.

## 20/20

Visual angles and cycles aren't used by doctors, the 20/20 method of determining visual acuity was invented in 1862 by a Dutch eye doctor, Herman Snellen. Snellen constructed a set of block leetters for which the entire height of the letter was 5x the height of each stroke, so an 'E' has a height of 5, and each protruding horizontal line is 1.

He then defined **visual acuity** as:

distance at which just able to identify the letters / distance at which a person with normal vision can just identify the letters

Further adaptions position the viewer at 20ft and the size of the letters were changed rather than the position of the viewer.

Normal vision became known as 20/20, at 20ft, you can read the same as a normal at 20ft.

20/20 is designed to be about 0.083 degrees at the eye for a **letter**, and therefore about 0.017 per stroke.

Therefore if you can read a 20/20 letter, you can discern the different strokes fo the letter, and are at 0.017 visual acuity.

If at 20ft you can read what a normal can at 40ft, you're 20/40. Most healthy young adults can achieve 20/15.

## Types of Visual Acuity

These finest strips that can be resolved will be called minimum resolvable acuity.
Smallest letter that can be recognizd is the minimum recognizable acuity.

### Minimum Visible Acuity - Detection of a feature - 0.00014

The smallest object/target that one can detect. Under ideal conditions, humans can detect a long dark line against a white background at an angle of about 0.00014 degrees.

This minimum visible acuity is so small for two reasons:

1. The optics of the eye spread the image of the thin line, making it much wider on the retina

2. Fuzzy retinal image of the line casts a shadow that reduces the light on a row of cones to either side

Influenced by our ability to discriminate the intensity of the target relative to its spatial background.

### Minimum Resolvable Acuity - Resolution of two features - 0.017

Minimum resolvable acuity refers to the smallest angular separation between neighbouring objects that one can resolve.

Today we define minimum resolvable acuity as the determination of the finest black and white stripes that can be resolved. Under ideal conditions, humans with very good vision can resolve black and white stripes when one cycle subtends an angle of about 0.017 degrees.

This is the finest high-contrast detail that cna be resolved. In foveal vision this limit is determined by the spacing of photoreceptors in the eye.

### Minimum Recognizable Acuity - Identification of a feature - 0.017

Angular size of the smallest feature that one can recognize or identify. Approach still used by eye doctors today introduced by Herman Snellen.

### Minimum Discriminable Acuity - Discrimination of a change in a feature - 0.00024

Angular size of the smallest change in a feature, size, position, orientation, that one can discriminate.

Most studied example is our ability to discern a difference in the relative positions of two features.

Visual system very good at telling where things are relative to each other. So telling if two lines are lined up, or if one is offset a bit is the Vernier Acuity. Vernier scale shows that humans are very good at judging whether two nearby lines are matched up or not.

Under ideal conditions, Vernier acuity may be 0.0008. This is impressive given that this is 10x smaller than even the smallet foveal cones.

Guiness World Record has 0.00024 for relative positioning.

## Acuity for Low-Contrast Stripes

**Spatial Frequency** = the number of times a pattern, like a sine wave, repeats in a space.

At 47 inches away, visual angle between pair of white stripes is about 0.25 degrees for example 3.6a), so that's 4 cycles per degree.

Schade found that much wider stripes are worse for distinguishing light from dark stripes.

The human **Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF)** shaped-like hill, for example, a 1-cycle degree grating must have a stripe contrast of about 1% to be distinguishable from uniform gray. Such as if mean luminance was 1000 photos, the different between dark and like would have to be 990 to 1010.

Contrast grating is generally specified according to the Michelson definition:

$C = \frac{(I_{max} - I_{min})}{I_{max} + I_{min}}$.

In our example, C = (1010 - 990) / (1010 + 990) = 0.01, 1%.

This is the **contrast threshold** and its reciprocal is 100, so this is the point plotted on the red CSF line, where we can distinguish the window of visibility, the threshold between seeing and not seeing.

**Contrast threshold** = smallest amount of contrast required to detect a pattern
**Contrast sensitivity function** = describes how the sensitivity to contrast, the reciprocal of the contrast threshold, depends on the spatial frequency, size, of the stimulus.

### Retinal Ganglion Cells and Stripes

Retinal ganglion cells respond vigorously to spots of light, but also stripes or gratings.

When the spatial frequency of the grating is too low, the ganglion cell responds weakly because part of the fat, bright bar of the grating lands in the inhibitory surround, damping the cell's response.

When the spatial frequency is too high, the ganglion cell responds weakly because both dark and bright stripes fall within the receptive-field center, washing out the response.

But with a bright bar in the center of its receptive field, and dark bars in the surround, the cell responds vigorously.

Therefore each ganglion cell is "tuned" to spatial frequency. Each cell responds best to a specific spatial frequency that matches its receptive-field size and it responds less to both higher and lower frequencies.

Responses also depend on the **phase** of the grating, its position within the receptive field.

Want bright in center, dark in surround of receptive field, shift that 90 degrees and it is blind, with a net balance of zero light vs dark in the receptive area and surround, making it blind.

Note that other ganglion cells located to the left or right might respond to this 90 degree shift, but not the base 0 degree scenario, therefore the visual system as a whole is balanced.

### Lateral Geniculate Nucleus

Axons of retinal ganglion cells synapse in the two **lateral geniculate nuclei**, one in each cerebral hemisphere. They are structures in the thalamus, part of the midbrain, that receive input from the retinal ganglion cells and input/output to the visual cortex.

These act as the realty stations on the way from the retina to the cortex. 6-layered stack, bent in the middle. The neurons in the bottom two layers are physically larger than those in the top four, and this makes the bottom two called the **magnocellular layers** and the top four the **parvocellular layers**. magno=large, parvo=small.

Magnocellular layers receive input from M ganglion cells, whereas the parvocellular layers receive input from P ganglion cells.

Magnocellular respond to large, fast-moving objects, parvoceullular is responsible for processing details of stationary targets.

**Koniocellular cells**, konio=dust, exist between the layers. The **left LGN** receives projections from the left side of the retina in both eyes, while the **right LGN** receives projections from the right side.

Each LGN has a map of a complete half of the visual field.
