## Visual Perception

**Motion aftereffect** = After viewing motion in a constant direction for a sustained period of time, we see any stationary objects that we view subsequently as moving in the opposite direction.

Motion detector cell: use an AND gate with left the signal delayed, so two cells, a left and a right. When the left receives signal, it delays sending, and then shuts down if the signal remains present for too long which would indicate stationary change not motion.

Moments later, the right side would get the motion, and also trigger, it sends its signal which meets up with the delayed signal from the left side, and they pass through the AND gate to signal the M cell.

## Apparent Motion

Have one spark occur at one spot and then another at another spot slightly moved. Observers don't report seeing two different sparks at two spots, but instead report seeing the one spark move from the first position smoothly to the second.

## The Correspondence Problem

If 5 balls are moving from top left to bottom right, how does the visual system associate the one on the left with the correct shifted one and get that smooth motion mapping from each one as it changes?

Because we have motion detectors for all directions, one detector will sense the diagonal motion implied by matching 1 to 2, and another 1 to 3. These detectors compete to determine the overall perception.

## Aperture Problem

The **Aperture Problem** explains that a different detector like those talked about earlier may win this competition when an object is viewed through an aperture than would win if we could see the whole object.

Grating moving across a window, is it moving up or left or diagonally? Cannot tell. A variety of contours of different orientations moving at different speeds can cause identical responses in a motion-sensitive neuron in the visual system.

The solution is to have another set of neurons listen to the V1 neurons and integrate with the potentially conflicting signals.

## Detection of Global Motion in Area MT

Info from magnocellular neurons feed into V1 and are passed on to the **middle temporal area (MT)** that is thought to be the site of global motion detection neurons in the visual system.

The vast majority of neurons in the MT are selective for motion in one particular direction, but show little selectivity for form or color.



## Motion Aftereffects

When we stare at a waterfall for a while, the detectors sensitive to downward motion become adapted. When we switch our gaze to a stationary object, such as the rocks next to the waterfall, the neurons sensitive to upward motion fire faster than the expended downward motion ones and we perceive the rocks as drifting upwards.

## Using Motion Information

**Optic flow** = The changing angular positions of points in a perspective image that we experience as we move through the world.

## Time to Collision (TTC)

We cannot calculate time for estimated distances and velocities fast enough to determine when an approaching frisbee will reach us, instead we use tau, information about the ratio of the retinal image size at any moment to the rate at which the image is expanding.

As the frisbee approaches, the image of the frisbee on your retina will grow larger. The ratio of the retinal image size at any moment to the rate at which the image is expanding is tau and TTC is proportional to tau.

## Eye Movements

**Smooth pursuit** = as you move a pencil across a piece of paper with a dot in the middle of it, from left to right, you perceive the pencil moving left to right, not the dot moving right to left, even though it made the same journey from being to the right of the pencil to the left.

The reason we see the pencil moving and not the dot is because of eye movement. Six muscles are attached to each eye, arranged in three pairs.

When trying to hold eyes stationary, they make small movements, drifts and jerks called **microsaccades**.

## Saccadic Suppression

Saccade is an eye movement in which the eyes rapidly change fixation from one object or location to another, saccadic suppression is how the visual system essentially shuts down for the duration of this large eye movement, so that we don't get a smear image from the rapid movement. Visual acuity gets suspended in a similar way to when we blink. Saccadic suppression eliminates the invalid retinal images captured during the brief saccade eye movement.

You cannot see your own saccadic eye movements, since your visual system shuts down during them, so have a friend watch your eye.

The stationary dot scenario can be explained by the eye sending out two copies of each order to move the eyes:

1. First is received by the eye muscles
2. Another goes to an area of the visual system called the comparator. The comparator can compensate for the image changes caused by the eye movement, inhibiting any attempts by other parts of the visual system to interpret the changes as object motion.

When we jiggle the eyeball with a finger, the dot on the page looks like it moves because no signal is sent from the eye muscles to the comparator, so the visual system is interpreted as the world being rocked.

The brain has to figure out which retinal motion arises in the world and which is generated by our eye movements. The brain must suppress the motion signals generated by our eye movements or the world will be appear *smeared*.

## Development of Motion Perception

Some parts of motion perception are present at birth, but sensitivity to global motion develops slower.

**first order motion** = the motion of an object that is defined by changes in position of luminance-defined objects over time.

**second order motion** = the motion of an object that is defined by differences in contrast or texture of objects, but not by luminance.

Can alternate the texture of a frame, flipping black bits to white and white to black, and we get  a perception of motion. Moving discrete objects across frames lik in first order motion is not necessary for motion perception.
