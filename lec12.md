# Chapter 5 Colour

Color is percept.

1. Color Detection
2. Color Discrimination
3. Color Appearance

ROYGBIV

Red = longest wavelengths
Violet = shortest wavelengths

Blue cones = most sensitive to short wavelengths, peak at 420nm, which is blue.
Green cones = most sensitive to yellows and greens, peak at 534nm.
Red cones = most sensitive to long wavelengths, peak at 564nm, which is yellow.

Rods are exposed to all colors, cones react to certain wavelengths.

## Principle of Univariance

There are many different wavelength combos that will elicit the same response.

## Scotopic

Dim light, still enough to cause a signal on a rod, but too dim for cones to respond. Gives a virtually colorless image, since rods are sensitive but don't have good color ability.

## Photopic

In bright lighting conditions, overwhelm rods and they stop producing useful signal.

Different cones have a variety of responses to different stimuli.

## Trichromacy

Any color of light is defined in our visual system by a relationship between the output of the three types of cones.

We define colors of light by combinining the responses from 3 different kinds of cones.

## Color Spaces

If all you have is a linear line from R to V, there are colors that aren't produced, need to combine them using RGB. No frequency of light alon the spectrum corresponds to magenta, it is a combo. No x nanometer value is magenta, the percept of it is constructed by the visual systema as a combo.

This makes magenta a **nonspectral color**.

Hue = basic color, like purple, green etc.

Brightness = without regard to the hue, how light or dark is it

Saturation = how colorful is it, how vivid is it. The intensity. How much color does it have versus gray.

Any combination of frequencies of light that produce the same result as another combination are called **Metamers**. The effect is the same.

## Color Opponency

We have mechanisms making comparisons in the visual system about how black and white, yellow and blue, red and green, something is. Our perception of color depends on the output of three more complicated mechanisms.

How much to one side or the other of two opposite things for these three opposing pairs.

## Hue cancellation

Cancel other colors by adding colors. Evidence shows that there are aspects of trichromacy and color opponency in how we discriminate color.

Trichromacy, early on at the retina, it adds up the L, S, M cone signals and determines what to send.

Also use color opponency, downstream in the visual system. In the LGN and visual cortex.

## Cone-Opponent Cells

A cell that has a L cone on in center, M off in surround. Then in all combos, can tell a lot about colors.

## Double Opponent Colour Cells

Put things together in the visual cortex to perform complex comparisons, cell's center is activated by L on, or M off, whereas surround is L off, M on.

So multiple info from L, M cones are contributing to its activation.

## Illuminant

Overall lighting conditions are the illumination of a scene.

Want our color vision to be reliable even if the illumination varies.

Change the lighting conditions, change the responses by L cones, etc.

But despite the change in illuminant, generally interpret the color as the same, so that in poor light, still able to distinguish color of objects properly.

## Colour Contrast

Neighbouring colors influence the percept of color you get from another.

## Colour Assimilation

Mix colors optically, and a square of little patches side-by-side may look like one big patch as a result of color assimilation and blending.

This is how pixels work when we look at them from further away.

## Colour Anomalous Vision

Color blindness is the more common term. There are certain colours people can't discriminate between as well as others. We all see colors differently.

Images at optometrist's office, such that if the image was grayscale, looks random, but with color, can see a number.

## Achromatopsia

Inability to perceive colors, not about cones, consequence of brain injury.

Person sees in grayscale.

## Colour Anomia or Agnosia

Inability to name colors, see them, but processing prevents them from being recognized for some reason, like other agnosias.
