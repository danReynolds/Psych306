# Thresholds

qualia are the experiences of hearing or feeling things.

Fechner, lost vision from sun experiments, got it back after years of isolation and was in debate between **dualism** and **materialism**.

Dualism believes that the mind is separate from the body.

Materialism says that the mind is what the brain does, all things result from the interaction of bits of matter.

**Panpsychism**: all things have a consciousness.

**Two point threshold**: measure smallest discernable distance between two pins on the body.

**Just noticeable difference**: difference required when lifting weights before you notice it. Anything below and won't notice it.

Fechner's Law, as as stimulus intensity grows, larger changes are requird for the changes to be detected by a perceiver. $S = k\log{R}$

**Absolute threshold** = minimum intensity of a stimulus that can be detected, faintest sound you can hear, etc.

the intensity at which a stimulus would be detected 50% of thee time is chosen as the threshold.

This is because sometimes we will detect stimuli, sometimes we won't, even with the same conditions, our owns system has variability.

**method of limits**: experiment begins with the same set of stimuli, instead of random presentation, go from low intensity to high. Listeners can report when they first hear the tone.

**method of adjustment**: subject is the one allowed to increase or decrease the stimulus' intensity.

**magnitude estimation**: psychophysical method that assigns values according to perceived magnitude of the stimuli, assign a value to sweetness of drink, and proportionally change that for each such drink

Relationship between stimulus intensity and sensation is described by **Steven's Power Law:** $S = aI^{b}$

Sensation S is related to intensity I by some exponent b. Sensation may rise with intensity squared.

**Weber's Law:** The perceived change detected in the intensity is a constant fraction K of the level of the stimulus I.

Weber's law involves a clear objective measurement. We know how much we varied the stimulus, and either the observers can tell that the stimulus changed or they cannot.

JND needs to get bigger at larger weights, harder to notice difference if we change 500lb to 501lb, vs 1lb to 2lb.

**Fechner's Law:** $S=k\log{R}$, where k is some constant, S is the perceived sensation and R is the actual intensity level. Need much more intensity for perceived changes to be noticeable as intensity grows.

Fechner's law assumes that all JNDs are perceptually equivalent, which is wrong. Not all things are perceived at such a rate. We don't respond to all such sensory modalities in the same pattern.

Light intensity has a different response curve than an electric shock, for example. Perceived intensity of electric shock is exponential, versus brightness which approaches logarithmic.

**Steven's Power Law**: no way to know if the data rater by $S=aI^{b}$ is objective right or wrong, just whether it is consistent. Exponent is to calculate different perceived sensations, electric shock has an I of 3.5, but brightness is 0.3, meaning it becomes less noticeable a perceived intensity as intensity increases.

Sweetness is similarly logarithmic, which is why pop is getting out of control in sugar content.

**Cross-modality matching**: Ability to match the intensities of sensations that come from different sensory modalities. For example, trying to match the intensity of a light to the intensity of a sound.

try to match perceived magnitudes across types of stimuli.

Tweak length of a line to match sweetness, for example. Across different sensory modalities, doing a magnitude estimation to match them across domains. As things get suggary, lines get longer in an orderly way.

Says for example that brightness of headlights are about the same as smell of back frying, when going from brightness to smell.

Propylthiouracil: people have a gene to taste this as bitter for some and like nothing for others. The population is pretty strongly separated in their response to bitter flavours.

Cross modality matching allows us to see the intensity differences by having people compare the taste to other modalities, and they rank the bitterness of this chemical over the sun as bright, whereas others say it isn't bright at all. Interesting.

**supertasters** are those individuals who experience the most intense taste sensations, for some stimuli, that are dramatically more intense than for medium or nontasters. Oral burn sensation greater than most.

Tongues of supertasters have tongues packed with more taste buds, by dying the tongue.  

## Signal Detection Theory:

Holds that the stimulus you're trying to detect, the signal, is always being detected in the presence of noise. If you sit somewhere quiet, you still hear something.

down near the minimum threshold, it will be hard to discern this internal noise from the stimulus.

Similarly, sometimes the signal of something like cancer will be lost in the surrounding noise. It won't be discerned because of the noise, although it is there.

signal in shower or just noise? Hard to discern.

Best you can do is decide on a **criterion** level of response, an internal threshold that is set by the observer. If it sounds louder than that criterion, than it is indeed a stimulus, and not noise.

Halfway between peaks is where you're not sure, closer to the phone peak than the shower peak is where you get a hit, versus a miss.

By knowing hte relationship of hits to false alarms, can develop a **sensitivity measure** known as d-prime.

**Sensitivity** = how well you can tell between the presence and absence of a signal

Two curves, noise and signal plus noise, difference between peaks is the sensitivity.

Now if you're waiting for an important call, can't be better, but can shift criterion, to catch more calls even if you get more false alarms too because of lower criterion. Adapt criterion with cost.

Can change criterion as a result of fear, coffee, etc. Criterion changes with cancer, for example.

If you plot false alarms against hits for different criterion values, you get a **receiver operating characteristic (ROC)** curve.

## Fourier Analysis

Air pressure in a sine wave changes sinusoidally. Any complex sound can be broken down into individual sine wave components that can be analyzed.

And can break into components and reconstruct these waves. Can add some to get superposition, cancellation.

## Doctrine of Specific Nerve Energies

Muller tells us that we cannot be directly aware of the world itself, only aware of the activity in our nerves. Which nerves are stimulated is more important than how they are stimulated.

**Cranial nerves** lead in and out of the skull, there are 12 pairs of these nerves that pass through small openings in the bone at the base of the skull.

**vitalism** = the idea that there is a force in life that is distnct from physical entities.
