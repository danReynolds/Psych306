## Evolutions in Protection

* Nuremberg Code 1949
* Belmont Report 1979
* Declaration of Helsinki 1964, 2008

## UWaterloo Proportionate Ethics Review

Minimal Risk:

You should be the expert in what is considered normal for your particular ideal participant group so that you can access what risks can result from their participation.

Imagine Kinesiologists analyzing their lung capacity on a bike for 30min, is that minimal risk?

Ask what is normal for the participant, are they a pro-rider? If so, minimal risk, but if they never bike, or are unfit, it could be dangerous.

## Principle 1: Respect for Persons

Respect for autonomy, participants have the right to give informed consent to participate in any study, and the process must be clear.

Protections for those with developing, impaired or diminished autonomy.

Special consideration for online spaces, doing online participation.

## Principle 2: Concern for Welfare

* Refers to how a person or group is fairing.
* Can be impacted on by many factors such as:
    * Physical, mental spiritiual, economic or social
    * Privacy, control of personal information

Welfare is protected by:
* minimizing exposure to unnecessary risks
* best possible balance of risks and benefits
* groups can be impacted by research or findings
* engagement during design process with groups is necessary
* need to consider risks and benefits to society

## Principle 3: Justice

* Obligation to treat people fairly and equitably
* No group unduly burdened by risks or denied benefits of knowledge generated
* Does not mean all participants should or can be treated the same
* Must be based on specific criteria justified by research question

Don't test drugs where its cheap if they can't then buy the drugs when they get to market, this is not justice.

* Inclusion based on scope and objectives of study not on easy access or manipulation
* Exclusion not on factors unrelated to research, age, gender just because they're harder
* Vulnerability must be considered but in context of study

## What is Considered research

Research is defined as:

> An undertaking intended to extend knowledge through disciplinary inquiry or systematic investigation.

Research integrity strives to follow the **best research practices honestly, accountably, openly and fairly in the search for and in the dissemination of knowledge.**

In most of the world, the only three behaviours that are breaches of research conduct are:

1. Fabricating data
2. Falsifying data
3. Plagiarism

These are the ones that receive massive scrutiny.

Your job is to create found results, not expected results.

Invalid authorship, don't include people who didn't contribute enough.

Destroying your research is also a breach.

Misrepresenting yourself, lie about credentials for research funding.

Submit corrections if you realize something is wrong and you made a mistake.

Don't coerce others, don't allow bullying or manipulation.

## Accidental Viewpoint

Visual info you get is misleading, man is holding up tower Pisa or pinching your head.

It is a viewing position that produces apparent regularity in the image that misrepresents reality.

## Slight of Hand and Close Up Magic

## Ambiguous Figure

A line drawing of a cube can be interpreted in multiple ways, is it popping out in the bottom left or top right.

Middle vision gets tripped up because it relies on vision being true.

## Apparent Occlusion and Relatability

Connect with a smooth elbow curve is **relatable**

Connect with an S curve **unrelatable**

We are able to connect certain things in our mind depending on the shape required of the part that is missing. So if we can make a nice smooth curve, we can do it, but if it would be connected by something more complex like a S-curve, our brain doesn't make that jump.

## Global Superiority Effect

Give priority to whole of a figure than its individual pieces. It's easier and faster to see a Q made up of smaller r's to call it a big Q then a mob of r's.

## Nonaccidental Features

Find conjunctions of edges, interpret them quickly as strong evidence for 3D forms. A T junction means something is in front of something. A Y junction means that we are looking straight on at an object.

## Middle vision

1. Bring together
2. Split asunder
3. Use what you know
4. Avoid Accidents (What are the expected scenarios, not low probability ones, go with likely scenario)
5. Seek Consensus (No Ambiguity)
