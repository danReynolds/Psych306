# Hearing

Amplitude is associated with loudness.

Frequency is associated with pitch: low-frequency sounds correspond to low pitches, and high-frequency sounds are high-pitched.

The **fundamental frequency** is the lowest frequency component of a complex periodic sound. All the other harmonics have frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental.

**Timbre** = the psychological sensation by which a listener can judge that two sounds with the same loudness and pitch are dissimilar.

## Basic Structure of the Mammalian Auditory System

### Outer Ear (Pinnae + Ear Canal)

**Pinnae** = the outer part of the ear that we can see.

Sound waves are funneled by the Pinnae into the **ear canal**.

The canal enhances sounds and protects the **tympanic membrane**, the eardrum, from damage.

The **tympanic membrane** is a thin sheet of skin that moves in and out in response to the pressure changes of sound waves.

### Middle Ear

Tympanic membrane is the border between the outer and middle ear. The middle ear consists of three tiny bones, the **ossicles**, that amplify sound waves.

**Ossicles**:

1. **Malleus**: Connected to the tympanic membrane on one side and to the second ossicle, the **incus**, on the other.

2. **Incus**: The incus is connected in turn to the third ossicle, the **stapes**.

3. **Stapes**: The stapes transmits the vibrations of sound waves to the **oval window**, another membrane, which forms the border between the middle ear and the inner ear.

The Ossicles amplify sound and increase energy in two ways:

1. The joints between the bones are hinged like levers and a small amount of energy on one side becomes larger on the other. This lever action increases the pressure change by about a third.

2. The ossicles also concentrate energy by from a larger surface area to a smaller one. The tympanic membrane, moved by the malleus, is about 18x as large as the oval window, which is moved by the stapes.

Pressure on the oval window is magnified 18x that on the tympanic membrane.

The middle ear has two muscles:

1. **Tensor tympani**: attached to the malleus.

2. **Stapedius**: attached to the stapes.

Their main purpose is to tense when sounds are very loud. They restrict movement of the ossicles and muffle pressure changes that might be large enough to damage the ear.

But the muscles are not fast enough, so can help with prolonged loud sounds, but a gunshot for example is too fast to react to.

### Inner Ear

**Cochlea**: Major structure of the inner ear, a tiny coiled structure embedded in the temporal bone of the skull. Looks like a snail's shell, filled with watery fluids in three parallel canals:

1. **Tympanic canal**

2. **Vestibular canal**

3. **Middle Canal**

Tympanic and vestibular canals are connected by a small opening called the **helicotrema** and these two canals are wrapped around the middle canal.

The three canals are separated by two membranes, **Reissner's membrane** between the vestibular and middle canal and **basilar's membrane** between the middle canal and the tympanic canal.

The basilar membrane forms the base of the **cochlear partition**, a complex structure through which sound waves are transduced into neural signals.

The stapes push and pull the flexible oval window in and out of the vestibular canal at the base of the cochlea. This movement of the oval window causes waves of pressure changes too flow through the fluid into the vestibular canal.

When the vestibular canal bulges out from these pressure changes, it pushes on the adjacent middle canal that it is wrapped tightly around and this pressure has the effect of displacing the basilar membrane.

**Organ of Corti** = Movements of the cochlear partition are translated into neural signal by structures in this organ, which extends along the top of the basilar membrane.

The organ of Corti is made up of a scaffold of cells that support specialized neurons called **hair cells** and dendrites of auditory nerve fibers that terminate at the base of hair cells.

Hair cells are arranged in four rows running down the basilar membrane. Inner and outer hair cells provide the foundation for tiny bristles called **stereocilia**.

The **tectorial membrane** extends atop the organ of Corti.

### Inner and Outer Hair Cells

Hair cells, like photoreceptors in the retina, are specialized neurons that transduce sound pressure into neural firing.

Hair cells in the vestibular organs also report head movements to the brain. Movement of a hair cell's stereocilia causes a change in voltage potential that releases neurotransmitters that encourage firing by auditory nerve fibers that have dendritic synapses on hair cells.

### Difference between Photoreceptors and Hair Cells

While the retina has almost 100 million photoreceptors, the cochlea has only 14,000 hair cells. Despite fewer numbers, stereocilia of hair cells are faster and more sensitive than photoreceptors.

Hair cells must be capable of responding so fast that we can detect time differences as little as 10 microseconds in order to know the direction from which a sound arrives.

While eyes can take time to adjust to a dark environment, ears are always ready for the slightest sound.

### Summary of Hearing Process

An air pressure wave is funneled by the pinna through the auditory canal to the tympanic membrane, which vibrates back and forth it time with the sound wave.

The tympanic membrane vibrates the malleus, which vibrates the incus, which vibrates the stapes, which pushes and pulls on the oval window.

The movement of the oval window causes pressure bulges to move down the length of the vestibular canal, and these bulges in the canal displace the middle canal up and down.

This up-and-down motion forces the tectorial membrane to shear across the organ of Corti, moving the stereocilia atop the hair cells back and forth.

The pivoting of the stereocilia initiates a rapid depolarization that results in spurts of neurotransmitters released into synapses between the hair cells and the dendrites of auditory nerve fibers synapsed on the hair cells.

These neurotransmitters initiate action potentials in the auditory nerve fibers that are carried to the brain.

## Amplitude and Frequency in the Cochlea

If the amplitude of a sound wave is increased, then the tympanic membrane and oval window move farther in and out with each pressure fluctuation.

The result is that the bulge in the vestibular canal becomes larger, causing the cochlear partition to move farther up and down, which causes the tectorial membrane to shear across the organ of Corti more forcefully, which causes the hair cells to pivot farther back and forth, which causes more neurotransmitters to be released, which causes the auditory nerve fibers to fire action potentials more quickly.

Larger the amplitude, higher the firing rate of the neurons that communicate with the brain.

Coding for frequency works slightly differently, the cochlear partition is displaced up and down in different places along the basilar membrane that correspond to different frequencies in the sound wave.

High frequencies cause the largest displacement closer to the oval window, near the base of the cochlea. Lower frequencies cause displacements farther away and nearer the apex. Different places on the cochlea are tuned to different frequencies, this is called **place code**.

The cochlea is like an acoustic prism because its sensitivity spreads across different sound frequencies along its length. The narrower end toward the base is stiffer and most sensitive to higher frequencies. The wider, more flexible end at the apex is most sensitive to low frequencies.

## Auditory Nerve

Sounds with different frequencies displace different regions of the cochlear partition. Inner hair cells provide most of the info to the brain via auditory nerve fibers and are lined up single file along the length of the basilar membrane.

Different fibers respond to different sound frequencies.

The frequency that increases the neuron's firing rate at the lowest intensity is called the neuron's **characteristic frequency (CF).**

A low-intensity sine wave tone with a certain frequency will cause certain auditory nerve fibers to increase their firing rates, while other AN fibers continue to fire at a spontaneous rate. As long as the brain knows which AN fibers have which characteristic frequencies, the brain can interpret the pattern of firings rates across all AN fibers to determine the frequency of any tone.

## Two-Tone Suppression

The rate at which an AN fiber responds changes when energy is introduced at nearby frequencies. When a second tone of a slightly different frequency is added, the rate of neural firing for the first tone decreases. This phenomenon is called **two-tone suppression**, and occurs especially when the second tone, the suppressor, has a lower frequency than the first tone.

**Rate saturation** = AN fibers fire in response to the displacement of stereocilia on hair cells. The farther stereocilia pivot, the faster AN fibers linked to that hair cell fire.

At certain frequencies, the fiber's firing rate maxes out and saturates. Stereocilia are pivoting as much as they can at this point, so increasing the frequency of the tone has no additional effect on the AN fiber's firing rate until we increase the frequency above the fiber's CF and the firing rate starts dropping again.

**Low Spontaneous Fibers** = An auditory nerve fiber that has a low rate, less than 10 spikes per second, of spontaneous firing, low spontaneous fibers require relatively intense sound before they will fire at higher rates.

**High Spontaneous Fibers** = An auditory nerve fiber that has a high rate, more than 30 spikes per second, of spontaneous firing, high spontaneous fibers increase their firing rate in response to relatively low levels of sound.

High spontaneous AN fibers are like rods in the retina, they are especially sensitive to low levels of sound, responding at rates above resting level even when decibel levels are low.

But they become quickly saturated, so their frequency selectivit4y is relatively poor when intensity is relatively high.

Low spontaneous fibers are more like cones, requiring higher intensity sound waves to start responding, but retain their frequency selectivity over a broader range of intensity.

## Temporal Code for Sound Frequency

Many AN fibers tend to fire action potentials at one particular point in the phase of a sound wave, a phenomenon called **phase locking**.

While for high frequencies like > 1000Hz, fibers cannot produce action potentials quickly enough to fire on every cycle of the sound, but together neurons could take turns to record action potentials of each cycle, this coordination is called the **volley principle**, the idea that multiple neurons can provide a temporal code for frequency if each neuron fires at a distinct point in the period of a sound wave but not every period.

Place coding and phase locking together let the neurons know the timing and frequency of sound waves.

## Auditory Brain Structures

All AN fibers initially synapse in the **cochlear nucleus**, which consists of three subnuclei.

The cochlear nucleus contains many different types of specialized neurons. Some are especially sensitive to onsets of sound at particular frequencies.

Some are sensitive to the coincidence of onsets across many frequencies, firing when multiple frequencies begin, but stopping if the sound continues.

Some neurons appear to serve as little more than quick relays from the cochlea to the **superior olive**, an early brain stem region in the auditory pathway where inputs from both ears converge.

Neurons from the cochlear nucleus and superior olive travel up the brain stem to the **inferior colliculus**, coming mostly from the contralateral to the left and right inferior colliculus respectively.

The **medial geniculate nucleus** of the thalamus is the last stop in the auditory pathway before the cerebral cortex.

All structures of the auditory system, beginning with the basilar membrane and continuing through the cochlear nucleus, superior olive, inferior colliculus, and medial geniculate nucleus show a consistent organizational pattern in which neurons are aligned based on the frequencies to which they are most sensitive.

Neurons most responsive to low frequencies lie on one edge of each structure and high frequencies on the other edge, with orderly frequencies in-between.

This **tonotopic organization** reflects both the early mechanical properties of transduction and the importance of the frequency composition of sounds for auditory perception.

## Primary Auditory Cortex

Called A1, the primary auditory cortex is the first area within temporal lobes of the brain responsible for processing acoustic information.

the **belt area** is a region of the cortex directly adjacent to A1 with inputs from A1 where neurons respond to more complex characteristics of sound.

**parabelt area** = a region of the cortex lateral and adjacent to the belt area where neurons respond to more complex characteristics of sound, as well as to input from other senses.

## Basic Operating Characteristics of the Auditory System

Psychoacoustics = the study of the psychological correlates of the physical dimensions of acoustics, a branch of psychophysics.

Sounds are measured in respect to frequency, but listeners hear pitch.

## Intensity and Loudness

Sounds of different frequencies at varying amplitudes can sound equally loud. A high frequency lower amplitude sound can sound as loud as a lower frequency higher amplitude sound.

The loudness of a sound also depends on its duration. Longer sounds are heard as being louder. The reason this happens that that the perception of loudness depends on the summation of energy over a brief period of time, a process called **temporal integration**.

For hearing this lasts 100ms-200ms, so a sound presented for less than 100ms will be perceived as softer than an equal sound for 300ms.

As sounds become more intense, many more AN fibers become excited.

## Frequency and Pitch

Frequency is not perfectly correlated with pitch. Listeners will perceive a greater rise in pitch for lower frequencies than they do for higher frequencies. A listener perceives a greater pitch shift when a tone shifts from 500 to 1000Hz than 5000 to 5500Hz.

Psychoacousticians use **Masking**, playing multiple frequencies at once and seeing how well a listener can pick out certain components.

Can mask the signal sine wave in **white noise**, noise consisting of all audible frequencies in equal amounts. While not is analogous to white light in vision, for which all wavelengths are present.

We can play a 2000Hz test tone with a white noise band of 1975 to 2025Hz in the background and adjust until person can just hear the test tone. Then we widen the bandwidth and they need to re-adjust the test tone's loudness until they can hear it again. But eventually widening the bandwidth of the noise does not affect the detection of the test tone. The size of the noise band at this point is called the **critical bandwidth**.

## Hearing Loss

Hearing can be impaired by damage to any of the structures along the chain from the outer ear to the auditory cortex.

Simplest way is to obstruct the ear canal. **Conductive hearing loss** occurs when the middle ear bones lose their ability to conduct vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the oval window.

This impairment can occur during ear infections and the condition is called **otitis media**. Oval window still vibrates, but without the amplification of the ossicles, significantly impaired.

**otosclerosis** = the abnormal growth of the middle ear bones, reducing hearing.

**sensorineural hearing loss** = most serious and common, occurs inside the cochlea and sometimes as a result of damage to the auditory nerve. Occurs when hair cells are injured. Certain antibiotics and cancer drugs are **ototoxic**, meaning they kill hair cells directly.

## Treating Hearing Loss

Hearing aids can be tuned to provide the greatest amplification only for frequencies in the region of greatest loss. They can also move energy from frequency regions in which hearing is poor into regions where hearing is normal.

Because the lower frequency region is already being used by for lower frequency sounds, this strategy requires squeezing together some lower frequency sounds to make room for high frequency sound that is being moved down.
