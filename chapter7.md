## Attention

Reaction time (RT) = the amount of time that elapses between the point when the probe appears and the point when the subject hits the response key.

**Exogenous Cue** = Directing attention to the desired final location of attention.

**Endogeneous Cue** = Directing attention near the current location of attention.

**Stimulus Onset Asynchrony** = the time between the onset of one stimulus and the onset of another.

**Inhibition of Return** = The dFifficulty in getting attention to move back to a recently attended location. Look once, then look again and can't look as fast.

## Spotlight of Attention

Attention starts at the fixation point and ends at the cued location. When we shift our gaze, our point of fixation sweeps across the intervening space, like a spotlight.

## Visual Search

In a visual search experiment, the observer looks for a target item among distractor items. Look for faces in a crowd, etc.

**Feature search** = search for a target defined by a single attribute, like color or orientation.

**Salience** = how much a stimulus stands out relative to its neighbours.

**Parallel Search** = process the color or orientation of all items at once, not sequentially.

## Inefficient Searches

If we need to attend to each item before moving to the next one, we are slow at searching. Serial searching like this is called **Serial self-terminating search**, in which items are examined one after another until either the target is found or all have been checked.

Basic features can be used to narrow down the search, even if they cannot eliminate all distractions = **Guided search**

**Conjunction searches** = no single feature defines the target, instead the target is defined by the conjunction, the co-occurrence of two or more features, such as red and vertical. Mid performance between efficient feature searches and inefficient serial searches.

**Scene-based guidance** = information in our understanding of scenes that helps us find specific objects in scenes. Know that the cup in the picture might be by the sink, depends on our understanding of the scene.

## Binding Problem in Visual Search

**Binding Problem** = the challenge of tying different attributes of visual stimuli, color, orientation, motion, which are handled by different brain circuits, to the appropriate object so that we perceive a unified object.

In **feature integration theory**, the basic features of color and orientation are available in a **preattentive stage** of processing, but we can't know how those features are bound together until we attend the object specifically. We can vaguely see something is red, but can we tell that its horizontal line is red versus its vertical just by parallel processing? Not as well.

If you look at coloured letters quickly, you can match the wrong color to a letter in recall, this is called an **illusory conjunction**, you have matched things together that you shouldn't have.

## Attentional Blink

**Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)** = An experimental feature in which stimuli appear in a stream at a location at a rapid rate. If letters appearing and changing rapidly in front of you, at what speed can you not tell if a letter was featured in the stream?

**Attentional blink** = If we're looking for T1 and T2 and we spot T1, then we are blinded for a moment before we're able to identify another target, so if T2 appears 200-300ms after T1 and if T1 is correctly reported, then we will miss T2. It is the tendency not to perceive or respond to the second of two different target stimuli amid a rapid stream of distracted stimuli if the observer has responded to the first target stimulus with 200-500ms before the second stimulus is presented.

## Disorders of Visual Attention

**Visual-field defect** = A portion of the visual field with no vision or with abnormal vision, typically resulting from damage to the visual nervous system.

### Neglect

Neglect patients behave as if part of the world was not there. Asked to describe what they are seeing a patient experiencing neglect of the left visual field will tend to name objects to the right and ignore those to the left.

The right side is well attended, and the left completely ignored.

Neglect patients might only eat what's on the right side of their plate, or shave only the right side of their face.

## Extinction

Possibly a milder form of neglect, if you hold up a fork in the weak side, they see the fork, but if you have a fork in the weak side and a spoon in the strong side, then the patient only sees the spoon in the strong side. The good stimulus has extinguished the weak stimulus. The patient can only attend to the stimulus in the weak field if it is **salient**. If there is also one in the good field, the weak one will go unattended.

The ipsilesional field is the same side as the lesion, and since the lesion effects the contralateral field, the ipsilesional field is the strong field.

## Perceiving and Understanding Scenes

**Ensemble Statistics** = Knowledge about the properties of a group of objects together.

People could differentiate between natural and urban scenes with just 19ms of exposure to a scene. 20-50ms to recognize just one object.

## Change Blindness

Shown a picture, then another similar one with something changed. We are slow to identify the changes in the picture from the previous one.

How can we remember thousands of objects after a more second or two of viewing, but we fail to notice change in a picture that is right in front of us?

We may not perceive what we do not expect to see, what does not fit with the current inference. This failure to notice the unexpected leads to the phenomenon of **inattentional blindness**. Gorilla running through basketball players.

The effects of attention manifest themselves in several different ways in the brain. In some cases attention is marked by a general increase in neural activity, or by a greater correlation between activity in different areas of the brain. In other cases, attention to a stimulus or location causes receptive fields to shrink so as to exclude unattended stimuli.

Selective processing helps for visual search, while non-selective processing allows observers to appreciate the mean and variance of features across many objects. You know the average orientation of trees in the woods due to non-selective processing, but if I ask you about a specific tree, you'd have to focus on it.
