## Binocular Rivalry

Conflict between the two separate halves of the visual system if you should different stimuli to the left and right

This is a **dichoptic** stimulus.

**Stereoacuity** = Smallest amount of disparity from which you can get stereopsis. Typically tested with dichoptic stimuli.

**Stereopsis** = the perception of depth produced by the reception in the brain of visual stimuli from both eyes in combination; binocular vision.

## Critical Period

A period in our developmental course where if we're getting visual stimulation, we can develop stereopsis.

If don't develop stereopsis in this critical period, will likely never develop it.

## Corresponding Retinal points

Anything you're looking at where it falls the same distance from the fovea on the left and right retina.

## Diplopia

nearer to or farther from horopter, gets blurry double image.

Anything closer than horopter have crossed disparity, you'd need to cross your eyes to focus on it.

Further than horopter, need to diverge gaze outwards, uncrossed disparity.

Blurring the image, uniqueness constraint, continuity constraint are used to resolve correspondence of points between the retinas, binocular depth cues.

These binocular neurons are in the striate cortex.

## Consequences

Surprises, consequences that help us understand the visual system.

Horizontal lines inbetween slanted lines make us see railroad tracks.

## The Shepard Tables

Exact same quadrilaterals on same tables, but tables look so different

## Attention

## Reaction time

time between stimulus on and react to it.

## Cues

* Valid: given correct information about next stimulus
* Invalid: deliberately deceiving you about next stimulus
* Neutral: not giving information one way or another

## Stimulus Onset Asynchrony

Time between setting off cue and stimulus appearing.
